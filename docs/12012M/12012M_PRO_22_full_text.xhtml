   <p class="doc-ti">ON THE POSITION OF DENMARK</p>
   <p class="normal">THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
   <p class="normal">RECALLING the Decision of the Heads of State or Government, meeting within the European Council at Edinburgh on 12 December 1992, concerning certain problems raised by Denmark on the Treaty on European Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">HAVING NOTED the position of Denmark with regard to Citizenship, Economic and Monetary Union, Defence Policy and Justice and Home Affairs as laid down in the Edinburgh Decision,</p>
   <p class="normal">CONSCIOUS of the fact that a continuation under the Treaties of the legal regime originating in the Edinburgh decision will significantly limit Denmark's participation in important areas of cooperation of the Union, and that it would be in the best interest of the Union to ensure the integrity of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the area of freedom, security and justice,</p>
   <p class="normal">WISHING therefore to establish a legal framework that will provide an option for Denmark to participate in the adoption of measures proposed on the basis of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and welcoming the intention of Denmark to avail itself of this option when possible in accordance with its constitutional requirements,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING that Denmark will not prevent the other Member States from further developing their cooperation with respect to measures not binding on Denmark,</p>
   <p class="normal">BEARING IN MIND Article 3 of the Protocol on the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> integrated into the framework of the European Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:</p>
   <p id="d1e68-299-1" class="ti-section-1">PART I</p>
   <p id="d1e72-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 1</p>
   <p class="normal">Denmark shall not take part in the adoption by the Council of proposed measures pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The unanimity of the members of the Council, with the exception of the representative of the government of Denmark, shall be necessary for the decisions of the Council which must be adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p class="normal">For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
   <p id="d1e79-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 2</p>
   <p class="normal">None of the provisions of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, no measure adopted pursuant to that Title, no provision of any international agreement concluded by the Union pursuant to that Title, and no decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting any such provision or measure or any measure amended or amendable pursuant to that Title shall be binding upon or applicable in Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the competences, rights and obligations of Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the Community or Union <span class="italic">acquis</span> nor form part of Union law as they apply to Denmark. In particular, acts of the Union in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon which are amended shall continue to be binding upon and applicable to Denmark unchanged.</p>
   <p id="d1e87-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 2a</p>
   <p class="normal">Article 2 of this Protocol shall also apply in respect of those rules laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of that Treaty.</p>
   <p id="d1e92-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 3</p>
   <p class="normal">Denmark shall bear no financial consequences of measures referred to in Article 1, other than administrative costs entailed for the institutions.</p>
   <p id="d1e97-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 4</p>
   <p class="normal">1.   Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on a proposal or initiative to build upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> covered by this Part, whether it will implement this measure in its national law. If it decides to do so, this measure will create an obligation under international law between Denmark and the other Member States bound by the measure.</p>
   <p class="normal">2.   If Denmark decides not to implement a measure of the Council as referred to in paragraph 1, the Member States bound by that measure and Denmark will consider appropriate measures to be taken.</p>
   <p id="d1e114-299-1" class="ti-section-1">PART II</p>
   <p id="d1e118-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 5</p>
   <p class="normal">With regard to measures adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 26(1), Article 42 and Articles 43 to 46 of the Treaty on European Union, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and the implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Therefore Denmark shall not participate in their adoption. Denmark will not prevent the other Member States from further developing their cooperation in this area. Denmark shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing of operational expenditure arising from such measures, nor to make military capabilities available to the Union.</p>
   <p class="normal">The unanimity of the members of the Council, with the exception of the representative of the government of Denmark, shall be necessary for the acts of the Council which must be adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p class="normal">For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
   <p id="d1e128-299-1" class="ti-section-1">PART III</p>

   <p class="normal">Articles 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to measures determining the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States, or measures relating to a uniform format for visas.</p>
   <p id="d1e138-299-1" class="ti-section-1">PART IV</p>
   <p id="d1e142-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 7</p>
   <p class="normal">At any time Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, inform the other Member States that it no longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this Protocol. In that event, Denmark will apply in full all relevant measures then in force taken within the framework of the European Union.</p>
   <p id="d1e147-299-1" class="ti-art">Article 8</p>
   <p class="normal">1.   At any time and without prejudice to Article 7, Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, notify the other Member States that, with effect from the first day of the month following the notification, Part I shall consist of the provisions in the Annex. In that case Articles 5 to 8 shall be renumbered in consequence.</p>
   <p class="normal">2.   Six months after the date on which the notification referred to in paragraph 1 takes effect all Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and measures adopted to build upon this <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which until then have been binding on Denmark as obligations under international law, shall be binding upon Denmark as Union law.</p>

      <p class="doc-ti" id="d1e32-302-1">ANNEX</p>
      <p id="d1e38-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 1</p>
      <p class="normal">Subject to Article 3, Denmark shall not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The unanimity of the members of the Council, with the exception of the representative of the government of Denmark, shall be necessary for the acts of the Council which must be adopted unanimously.</p>
      <p class="normal">For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p id="d1e45-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 2</p>
      <p class="normal">Pursuant to Article 1 and subject to Articles 3, 4 and 8, none of the provisions in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, no measure adopted pursuant to that Title, no provision of any international agreements concluded by the Union pursuant to that Title, no decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting any such provision or measure shall be binding upon or applicable in Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the competences, rights and obligations of Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the Community or Union <span class="italic">acquis</span> nor form part of Union law as they apply to Denmark.</p>
      <p id="d1e53-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 3</p>
      <p class="normal">1.   Denmark may notify the President of the Council in writing, within three months after a proposal or initiative has been presented to the Council pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure, whereupon Denmark shall be entitled to do so.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.   If after a reasonable period of time a measure referred to in paragraph 1 cannot be adopted with Denmark taking part, the Council may adopt that measure referred to in paragraph 1 in accordance with Article 1 without the participation of Denmark. In that case Article 2 applies.</p>
      <p id="d1e66-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 4</p>
      <p class="normal">Denmark may at any time after the adoption of a measure pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union notify its intention to the Council and the Commission that it wishes to accept that measure. In that case, the procedure provided for in Article 331(1) of that Treaty shall apply <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span>.</p>
      <p id="d1e74-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 5</p>
      <p class="normal">1.   The provisions of this Protocol apply for Denmark also to measures proposed or adopted pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union amending an existing measure by which it is bound.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.   However, in cases where the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, determines that the non-participation of Denmark in the amended version of an existing measure makes the application of that measure inoperable for other Member States or the Union, it may urge it to make a notification under Article 3 or 4. For the purposes of Article 3 a further period of two months starts to run as from the date of such determination by the Council.</p>
      <p class="normal">If, at the expiry of that period of two months from the Council's determination, Denmark has not made a notification under Article 3 or Article 4, the existing measure shall no longer be binding upon or applicable to it, unless it has made a notification under Article 4 before the entry into force of the amending measure. This shall take effect from the date of entry into force of the amending measure or of expiry of the period of two months, whichever is the later.</p>
      <p class="normal">For the purpose of this paragraph, the Council shall, after a full discussion of the matter, act by a qualified majority of its members representing the Member States participating or having participated in the adoption of the amending measure. A qualified majority of the Council shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.   The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may determine that Denmark shall bear the direct financial consequences, if any, necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in the existing measure.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.   This Article shall be without prejudice to Article 4.</p>
      <p id="d1e101-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 6</p>
      <p class="normal">1.   Notification pursuant to Article 4 shall be submitted no later than six months after the final adoption of a measure if this measure builds upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
      <p class="normal">If Denmark does not submit a notification in accordance with Articles 3 or 4 regarding a measure building upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, the Member States bound by that measure and Denmark will consider appropriate measures to be taken.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.   A notification pursuant to Article 3 with respect to a measure building upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> shall be deemed irrevocably to be a notification pursuant to Article 3 with respect to any further proposal or initiative aiming to build upon that measure to the extent that such proposal or initiative builds upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
      <p id="d1e128-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 7</p>
      <p class="normal">Denmark shall not be bound by the rules laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of that Treaty where Denmark is not bound by the rules governing the forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation which require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16.</p>
      <p id="d1e133-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 8</p>
      <p class="normal">Where, in cases referred to in this Part, Denmark is bound by a measure adopted by the Council pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the relevant provisions of the Treaties shall apply to Denmark in relation to that measure.</p>
      <p id="d1e138-302-1" class="ti-art">Article 9</p>
      <p class="normal">Where Denmark is not bound by a measure adopted pursuant to Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it shall bear no financial consequences of that measure other than administrative costs entailed for the institutions unless the Council, with all its Members acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, decides otherwise.</p>
