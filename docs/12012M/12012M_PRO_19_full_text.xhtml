   <p class="doc-ti" id="d1e32-290-1">PROTOCOL (No 19)</p>
   <p class="doc-ti">ON THE SCHENGEN <span class="italic">ACQUIS</span> INTEGRATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN UNION</p>
   <p class="normal">THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING that the Agreements on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders signed by some Member States of the European Union in Schengen on 14 June 1985 and on 19 June 1990, as well as related agreements and the rules adopted on the basis of these agreements, have been integrated into the framework of the European Union by the Treaty of Amsterdam of 2 October 1997,</p>
   <p class="normal">DESIRING to preserve the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, as developed since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and to develop this <span class="italic">acquis</span> in order to contribute towards achieving the objective of offering citizens of the Union an area of freedom, security and justice without internal borders,</p>
   <p class="normal">TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the special position of Denmark,</p>
   <p class="normal">TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland do not participate in all the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>; that provision should, however, be made to allow those Member States to accept other provisions of this <span class="italic">acquis</span> in full or in part,</p>
   <p class="normal">RECOGNISING that, as a consequence, it is necessary to make use of the provisions of the Treaties concerning closer cooperation between some Member States,</p>
   <p class="normal">TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the need to maintain a special relationship with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, both States being bound by the provisions of the Nordic passport union, together with the Nordic States which are members of the European Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:</p>
   <p id="d1e82-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 1</p>
   <p class="normal">The Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Hungary, Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden shall be authorised to establish closer cooperation among themselves in areas covered by provisions defined by the Council which constitute the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>. This cooperation shall be conducted within the institutional and legal framework of the European Union and with respect for the relevant provisions of the Treaties.</p>
   <p id="d1e90-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 2</p>
   <p class="normal">The Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> shall apply to the Member States referred to in Article 1, without prejudice to Article 3 of the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003 or to Article 4 of the Act of Accession of 25 April 2005. The Council will substitute itself for the Executive Committee established by the Schengen agreements.</p>
   <p id="d1e104-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 3</p>
   <p class="normal">The participation of Denmark in the adoption of measures constituting a development of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, as well as the implementation of these measures and their application to Denmark, shall be governed by the relevant provisions of the Protocol on the position of Denmark.</p>
   <p id="d1e112-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 4</p>
   <p class="normal">Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland may at any time request to take part in some or all of the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
   <p class="normal">The Council shall decide on the request with the unanimity of its members referred to in Article 1 and of the representative of the Government of the State concerned.</p>
   <p id="d1e122-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 5</p>
   <p class="normal">1.   Proposals and initiatives to build upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> shall be subject to the relevant provisions of the Treaties.</p>
   <p class="normal">In this context, where either Ireland or the United Kingdom has not notified the Council in writing within a reasonable period that it wishes to take part, the authorisation referred to in Article 329 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall be deemed to have been granted to the Member States referred to in Article 1 and to Ireland or the United Kingdom where either of them wishes to take part in the areas of cooperation in question.</p>
   <p class="normal">2.   Where either Ireland or the United Kingdom is deemed to have given notification pursuant to a decision under Article 4, it may nevertheless notify the Council in writing, within three months, that it does not wish to take part in such a proposal or initiative. In that case, Ireland or the United Kingdom shall not take part in its adoption. As from the latter notification, the procedure for adopting the measure building upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> shall be suspended until the end of the procedure set out in paragraphs 3 or 4 or until the notification is withdrawn at any moment during that procedure.</p>
   <p class="normal">3.   For the Member State having made the notification referred to in paragraph 2, any decision taken by the Council pursuant to Article 4 shall, as from the date of entry into force of the proposed measure, cease to apply to the extent considered necessary by the Council and under the conditions to be determined in a decision of the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. That decision shall be taken in accordance with the following criteria: the Council shall seek to retain the widest possible measure of participation of the Member State concerned without seriously affecting the practical operability of the various parts of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, while respecting their coherence. The Commission shall submit its proposal as soon as possible after the notification referred to in paragraph 2. The Council shall, if needed after convening two successive meetings, act within four months of the Commission proposal.</p>
   <p class="normal">4.   If, by the end of the period of four months, the Council has not adopted a decision, a Member State may, without delay, request that the matter be referred to the European Council. In that case, the European Council shall, at its next meeting, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, take a decision in accordance with the criteria referred to in paragraph 3.</p>
   <p class="normal">5.   If, by the end of the procedure set out in paragraphs 3 or 4, the Council or, as the case may be, the European Council has not adopted its decision, the suspension of the procedure for adopting the measure building upon the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> shall be terminated. If the said measure is subsequently adopted any decision taken by the Council pursuant to Article 4 shall, as from the date of entry into force of that measure, cease to apply for the Member State concerned to the extent and under the conditions decided by the Commission, unless the said Member State has withdrawn its notification referred to in paragraph 2 before the adoption of the measure. The Commission shall act by the date of this adoption. When taking its decision, the Commission shall respect the criteria referred to in paragraph 3.</p>
   <p id="d1e164-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 6</p>
   <p class="normal">The Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway shall be associated with the implementation of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and its further development. Appropriate procedures shall be agreed to that effect in an Agreement to be concluded with those States by the Council, acting by the unanimity of its Members mentioned in Article 1. Such Agreement shall include provisions on the contribution of Iceland and Norway to any financial consequences resulting from the implementation of this Protocol.</p>
   <p class="normal">A separate Agreement shall be concluded with Iceland and Norway by the Council, acting unanimously, for the establishment of rights and obligations between Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the one hand, and Iceland and Norway on the other, in domains of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> which apply to these States.</p>
   <p id="d1e177-290-1" class="ti-art">Article 7</p>
   <p class="normal">For the purposes of the negotiations for the admission of new Member States into the European Union, the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and further measures taken by the institutions within its scope shall be regarded as an <span class="italic">acquis</span> which must be accepted in full by all States candidates for admission.</p>
