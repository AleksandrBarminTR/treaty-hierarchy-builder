   <p class="doc-ti" id="d1e32-281-1">PROTOCOL (No 13)</p>
   <p class="doc-ti">ON THE CONVERGENCE CRITERIA</p>
   <p class="normal">THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
   <p class="normal">DESIRING to lay down the details of the convergence criteria which shall guide the Union in taking decisions to end the derogations of those Member States with a derogation, referred to in Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:</p>
   <p id="d1e48-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 1</p>
   <p class="normal">The criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall mean that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than 1 ½ percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the consumer price index on a comparable basis taking into account differences in national definitions.</p>
   <p id="d1e53-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 2</p>
   <p class="normal">The criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) of the said Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.</p>
   <p id="d1e58-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 3</p>
   <p class="normal">The criterion on participation in the Exchange Rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism on the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period.</p>
   <p id="d1e63-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 4</p>
   <p class="normal">The criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities, taking into account differences in national definitions.</p>
   <p id="d1e68-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 5</p>
   <p class="normal">The statistical data to be used for the application of this Protocol shall be provided by the Commission.</p>
   <p id="d1e73-281-1" class="ti-art">Article 6</p>
   <p class="normal">The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, the ECB and the Economic and Financial Committee, adopt appropriate provisions to lay down the details of the convergence criteria referred to in Article 140(1) of the said Treaty, which shall then replace this Protocol.</p>
