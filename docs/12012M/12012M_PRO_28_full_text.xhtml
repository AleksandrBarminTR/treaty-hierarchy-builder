   <p class="normal">RECALLING that the provisions of Part Three, Title XVIII, on economic, social and territorial cohesion as a whole provide the legal basis for consolidating and further developing the Union's action in the field of economic, social and territorial cohesion, including the creation of a new fund,</p>
   <p class="normal">RECALLING that the provisions of Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union envisage setting up a Cohesion Fund,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING that the European Investment Bank is lending large and increasing amounts for the benefit of the poorer regions,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING the desire for greater flexibility in the arrangements for allocations from the Structural Funds,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING the desire for modulation of the levels of Union participation in programmes and projects in certain countries,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING the proposal to take greater account of the relative prosperity of Member States in the system of own resources,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRM that the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion is vital to the full development and enduring success of the Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRM their conviction that the Structural Funds should continue to play a considerable part in the achievement of Union objectives in the field of cohesion,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRM their conviction that the European Investment Bank should continue to devote the majority of its resources to the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion, and declare their willingness to review the capital needs of the European Investment Bank as soon as this is necessary for that purpose,</p>

   <p class="normal">DECLARE their intention of allowing a greater margin of flexibility in allocating financing from the Structural Funds to specific needs not covered under the present Structural Funds regulations,</p>
   <p class="normal">DECLARE their willingness to modulate the levels of Union participation in the context of programmes and projects of the Structural Funds, with a view to avoiding excessive increases in budgetary expenditure in the less prosperous Member States,</p>
