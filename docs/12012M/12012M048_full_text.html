If the European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, adopts by a simple majority a decision in favour of examining the proposed amendments, the President of the European Council shall convene a Convention composed of representatives of the national Parliaments, of the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, of the European Parliament and of the Commission. The European Central Bank shall also be consulted in the case of institutional changes in the monetary area.

In the latter case, the European Council shall define the terms of reference for a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States.</p><p>4. A conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened by the President of the Council for the purpose of determining by common accord the amendments to be made to the Treaties.</p><p>The amendments shall enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p><p>5.

This subparagraph shall not apply to decisions with military implications or those in the area of defence.</p><p>Where the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for legislative acts to be adopted by the Council in accordance with a special legislative procedure, the European Council may adopt a decision allowing for the adoption of such acts in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.</p><p>Any initiative taken by the European Council on the basis of the first or the second subparagraph shall be notified to the national Parliaments.
