   <p class="doc-ti" id="d1e32-313-1">PROTOCOL (No 30)</p>
   <p class="doc-ti">ON THE APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO POLAND AND TO THE UNITED KINGDOM</p>
   <p class="normal">THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS the Charter is to be applied in strict accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 6 and Title VII of the Charter itself,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS the aforementioned Article 6 requires the Charter to be applied and interpreted by the courts of Poland and of the United Kingdom strictly in accordance with the explanations referred to in that Article,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS the Charter contains both rights and principles,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS the Charter contains both provisions which are civil and political in character and those which are economic and social in character,</p>
   <p class="normal">WHEREAS the Charter reaffirms the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in the Union and makes those rights more visible, but does not create new rights or principles,</p>
   <p class="normal">RECALLING the obligations devolving upon Poland and the United Kingdom under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Union law generally,</p>
   <p class="normal">NOTING the wish of Poland and the United Kingdom to clarify certain aspects of the application of the Charter,</p>
   <p class="normal">DESIROUS therefore of clarifying the application of the Charter in relation to the laws and administrative action of Poland and of the United Kingdom and of its justiciability within Poland and within the United Kingdom,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRMING that references in this Protocol to the operation of specific provisions of the Charter are strictly without prejudice to the operation of other provisions of the Charter,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRMING that this Protocol is without prejudice to the application of the Charter to other Member States,</p>
   <p class="normal">REAFFIRMING that this Protocol is without prejudice to other obligations devolving upon Poland and the United Kingdom under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Union law generally,</p>
   <p class="normal">HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:</p>
   <p id="d1e71-313-1" class="ti-art">Article 1</p>
   <p class="normal">1.   The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.</p>
   <p class="normal">2.   In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.</p>
   <p id="d1e84-313-1" class="ti-art">Article 2</p>
   <p class="normal">To the extent that a provision of the Charter refers to national laws and practices, it shall only apply to Poland or the United Kingdom to the extent that the rights or principles that it contains are recognised in the law or practices of Poland or of the United Kingdom.</p>
