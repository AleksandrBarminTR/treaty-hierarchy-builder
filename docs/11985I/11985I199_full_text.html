<p>++++</p><p>Article 199  </p><p>1 . Where duties in the customs tariff of the Portuguese Republic differ in nature from the corresponding duties in the Common Customs Tariff or the ECSC unified tariff , the progressive alignment of the former on the latter shall be effected by adding the components of the Portuguese basic duty to those of the Common Customs Tariff or the ECSC unified tariff , the Portuguese basic duty being reduced to zero progressively , in accordance with the timetable set out in Articles 197 and 243 ( 2 ) and the duty in the Common Customs Tariff or ECSC unified tariff increasing from zero to reach the full amount progressively in accordance with the same timetable .  </p><p>2 . From 1 March 1986 , if certain duties in the Common Customs Tariff or the ECSC unified tariff are altered or suspended , the Portuguese Republic shall simultaneously amend or suspend its tariff in the proportion resulting from the implementation of Article 197 .  </p><p>3 . The Portuguese Republic shall apply the Common Customs Tariff and ECSC unified tariff nomenclatures from 1 March 1986 .  </p><p>The Portuguese Republic may include within these nomenclatures national subdivisions existing at the time of accession which are indispensable in order that the progressive alignment of its customs duties with those in the Common Customs Tariff and the ECSC unified tariff be carried out under the conditions laid down in this Act .  </p><p>Where amendments are made to the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff or the ECSC unified tariff in respect of products referred to in this Act , the Council may , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , adapt the nomenclature of those products as indicated in this Act .  </p><p>4 . With a view to implementing paragraph 3 and to facilitating the progressive introduction of the Common Customs Tariff and the ECSC unified tariff by the Portuguese Republic and the progressive abolition of customs duties between the Community as at present constituted and the Portuguese Republic , the Commission shall determine , if necessary , the implementing provisions whereby the Portuguese Republic alters its customs duties ; those implementing provisions may not however entail any amendment to Articles 189 and 197 .  </p><p>5 . The rate of duty calculated in accordance with Article 197 shall be applied by rounding up or down to the first decimal place .  </p><p>Rounding down shall be effected by deleting the second decimal where Portuguese duties are being aligned on Common Customs Tariff or ECSC unified tariff duties which are less than the Portuguese basic duties . In other cases rounding up shall be effected by applying the higher decimal .  </p>
