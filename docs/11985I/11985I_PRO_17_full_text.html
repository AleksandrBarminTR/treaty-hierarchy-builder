For the purposes of this Protocol , processing operations shall mean operations consisting in the processing in Portugal of goods temporarily exported from the Community as at present constituted with a view to their reimport into the Community as at present constituted in the form of compensating products .  </p><p>2 . Only natural or legal persons established in the present Community as at present constituted shall qualify for these arrangements .  </p><p>Any person referred to in the previous subparagraph who applies to qualify for these arrangements must satisfy the following conditions :  </p><p> ( a ) He must manufacture , on his own account , in a factory situated in the Community as at present constituted , similar products at the same stage of manufacture as the compensating products for which the arrangements are being requested .  </p><p> ( b ) He may have compensating products manufactured in Portugal within the framework of processing operations up to the limit of annual quantities fixed by the competent authorities of the Member State where the application is made , under the conditions described in point 3 .  </p><p> ( c ) The goods which he exports temporarily with a view to processing operations must be in free circulation in the Community as at present constituted within the meaning of Article 9 ( 2 ) of the EEC Treaty and must originate in the Community as at present constituted within the meaning of Regulation  ( EEC ) No 802/68 and the Implementing Regulations thereof . Derogations from the provisions of this point may be granted by the authorities of the present Member States only for goods of which Community production is insufficient . Such derogations may be granted only up to the limit of 14 % of the total value of the goods ( 1 ) for which the arrangements have been granted in the Member State concerned during the previous year .  </p><p>The present Member States shall communicate to the Commission at quarterly intervals the essential details of the derogations thus granted , namely , the nature , origin and quantities of the goods of non-Community origin concerned . The Commission shall communicate this information to the other Member States .  </p><p> ( d ) The processing operations to be carried out in Portugal must not constitute processing of greater importance than that laid down for each product in point 11 . The processing operations to be carried out may , however , constitute processing of lesser importance than that laid down for each product in point 11 .  </p><p>The present Member States may derogate from the provisions of ( a ) of the second subparagraph in respect of persons who do not satisfy the conditions of that subparagraph .  </p><p>Such derogations will apply only up to the total quantities imported under the specific arrangements existing prior to accession .  </p><p>In applying the derogations referred to in the previous subparagraph , preference will be given to persons who previously qualified for the specific arrangements referred to above . However , if such persons do not use up the whole of the quantities which they might claim , the remainder of those quantities may be granted to other persons .  </p><p>3 . The competent authorities of each Member State shall divide up , among the persons benefiting from the arrangements referred to in point 2 , the annual quantities of compensating products given in the table attached to this Annex , of which the present Member State concerned may authorize the reimport in accordance with the provisions of this Annex .  </p><p>4 . The competent authorities of the Member State into which the compensating products are to be reimported shall issue prior authorization to applicants satisfying the conditions laid down by this Annex .  </p><p>The prior authorization may be issued either once a year for the total quantity allotted to the applicant under ( b ) of the second subparagraph of point 2 , or in stages during the year for successive partial amounts of the quantity allotted until this is used up .  </p><p>The applicant shall submit to the competent authorities the contract concluded with the undertaking responsible for carrying out the processing operations on his account in Portugal , or any other proof deemed equivalent by those authorities .  </p><p>5 . The prior authorization shall be granted only if the competent authorities are able to identify the temporarily exported goods in the reimported compensating products .  </p><p>The competent authorities may refuse to grant the benefit of the arrangements where they observe that it is not possible for them to obtain all the guarantees enabling them to verify in practice that the provisions of point 2 are being complied with .  </p><p>The prior authorization shall lay down the conditions under which the processing operation must take place , in particular :  </p><p> - the quantities of goods to be exported and of products to be reimported calculated by reference to the rate of yield fixed on the basis of the technical data of the processing operation or operations to be carried out , if they have been established , or , failing these , the data available in the Community as at present constituted on operations of the same kind ,  </p><p> - the means by which the temporarily exported goods may be identified in the compensating products ,  </p><p> - the time limit for reimport on the basis of the time necessary to carry out the processing operation or operations .  </p><p>6 . On temporary exportation , the prior authorization issued by the competent authorities shall be presented at the customs office concerned for customs formalities to be accomplished .  </p><p>7 . The present Member States shall communicate to the Commission the figures concerning the prior authorizations issued each month , before the tenth day of the following month .  </p><p>At the request of the Commission , the present Member States shall inform the Commission of any refusal of prior authorization and of the reasons , with regard to the conditions laid down in this Protocol , which gave rise to the refusal .  </p><p>8 . Without prejudice to the following points , reimportation of compensating products may not be refused by any present Member State which has issued prior authorization for these products , subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in the said authorization and to other customs formalities normally required at the moment of import .  </p><p>These products may not be reimported into a present Member State other than that in which the prior authorization was issued .  </p><p>Where compensating products are reimported into the Community as at present constituted , the person making the declaration shall present to the competent authorities the prior authorization accompanied by proof that the processing operation took place in Portugal .  </p><p>9 . The competent authorities of the Member State concerned may , when circumstances so justify :  </p><p> - grant an extension of the time limit for reimportation initially fixed ,  </p><p> - authorize reimportation of compensating products in several consignments ; in this case , a note shall be taken of the prior authorization as and when the consignments arrive .  </p><p>The competent authorities of the Member State concerned may , in addition , authorize the reimportation of compensating products even if the processing operations provided for in the prior authorization have not been realized in their entirety .  </p><p>10 . The present Member States shall communicate to the Commission the statistical information relating to all reimportations which take place in their territory under this Protocol . The Commission shall communicate this information to the other present Member States .  </p><p>11 .
