<p>++++</p><p>Declaration by the European Economic Community  </p><p>on the adaptation and modernization of the Portuguese economy  </p><p>The accession of the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities affords the prospect of modernizing its economy and increasing its growth potential .  </p><p>To that end , a specific agricultural development programme previously defined in Article 263 and Protocol 24 shall apply immediately upon accession and shall be phased over a total of 10 years .  </p><p>A similar effort is called for in the industrial field , in order to modernize the production sector and to adapt it to European and international economic realities . The Community is prepared , in the same spirit as for agriculture , to aid Portuguese undertakings , by letting them benefit from its technical support and its credit instruments - both NCI and private operations - and by increased contributions from the European Investment Bank .  </p>
