The prices referred to in paragraph 1 shall , where appropriate , be converted to present worth by 1 March 1986 in accordance with the following rules :  </p><p> ( a ) Should Spanish prices , expressed in ECU , be higher than common prices , Spanish prices expressed in ECU shall be maintained at the levels corresponding to the prices recorded in the acts of the Conference .  </p><p>With regard more particularly to Spanish prices fixed for the 1985/86 marketing year , if their level expressed in ECU leads to an overrun of the variation existing for the 1984/85 marketing year between Spanish prices and common prices , the prices shall be fixed in future marketing years so that this overrun is totally absorbed during the first seven marketing years following accession as indicated in Article 70 ( 3 ) ( a ) and Article 135 ( c ) of the Act of Accession .  </p><p> ( b ) Should Spanish prices , expressed in ECU , be lower than common prices , their increase may not lead to the common prices for the products in question being exceeded .  </p><p>No overrun shall be taken into account for the application of the rules of discipline or alignment referred to in paragraph 1 .  </p><p>3 . For the purposes of the conversion of Spanish prices into ECU , account shall be taken , for the application of the rules for conversion to present worth of the prices referred to in paragraph 2 , of the difference existing between the exchange rate recorded at the beginning of the reference marketing year referred to in the acts of the Conference and the rate of conversion obtaining at the time prices are fixed for the following marketing year .  </p><p>In addition , where the value of the peseta varies by more than 5 % in relation to the value of the ECU between the time prices are fixed and the time they are implemented , account shall be taken of that alteration when the rules for conversion to present worth referred to in paragraph 2 are applied .  </p>
