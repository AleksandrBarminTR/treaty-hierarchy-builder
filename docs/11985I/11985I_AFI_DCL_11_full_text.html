<p>++++</p><p>Joint declaration  </p><p>on Protocol 2 concerning the Canary Islands and Ceuta and Melilla  </p><p>In the event of difficulties arising concerning the maintenance of traditional trade flows for Canary agricultural products , the Community is prepared to examine , within the context of the adjustment measures referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 25 ( 4 ) of the Act of Accession , the possibility of :  </p><p> - altering the tariff quotas between the various products within the overall volume of trade ,  </p><p> - substituting , whilst bearing in mind the absorption capacity of the Community market , for certain of the products covered by the tariff quotas other agricultural products originating in the Canary Islands , following the same criteria as those used for fixing the present tariff quotas .  </p><p>However , the Community recalls that deliveries under the tariff quotas will follow the rate of traditional trade flows , without thereby jeopardizing the possibility of exhausting the quotas .  </p><p>Moreover the Community does not exclude developments in tariff quotas for fishery products of Canary origin related to the reported development of the local Canary fishing fleet .  </p><p>For the tariff quotas referred to in Article 3 of Protocol 2 , administration &quot; by product &quot; may include groupings of products in relation to the general structure of production and trade of the products concerned with respect to the relevant destinations . These groupings should not lead to a substantial alteration in traditional trade flows between the Canary Islands and Ceuta and Melilla , and , on the one hand , that part of Spain which is included in the customs territory of the Community , and , on the other , the other Member States .  </p>
