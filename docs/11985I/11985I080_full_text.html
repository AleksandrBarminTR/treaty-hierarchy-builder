<p>++++</p><p>Article 80  </p><p>1 . Without prejudice to Article 79 , the Kingdom of Spain shall be authorized to maintain national aids , the abolition of which would not fail to have serious consequences both for producer and consumer prices . However , such aids can only be maintained on a transitional and , in principle , degressive basis , until not later than the end of the period of application of the transitional measures .  </p><p>2 . The Council , acting under the conditions set out in Article 91 , shall adopt the necessary measures for the implementation of the provisions of this Article . These measures shall include in particular the list and the exact wording of the aids referred to in paragraph 1 , the amount of the aids , the timetable of their abolition , any degressivity scale and the detailed rules necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the common agricultural policy ; these detailed rules must , in addition , ensure equal access to the Spanish market .  </p><p>3 . Should the need arise , a derogation may be made , during the period of application of the transitional measures , from the degressivity scale referred to in paragraph 2 .  </p>
