<p>++++</p><p>Article 72  </p><p>The differences in price levels in respect of which , in Section II , reference is made to this Article shall be compensated for as follows :  </p><p>1 . For products in respect of which prices are fixed in accordance with Articles 68 and 70 , the compensatory amounts applicable in trade between the Community as at present constituted and Spain , and between Spain and third countries , shall be equal to the difference between the prices fixed for Spain and the common prices .  </p><p>However , the compensatory amount established in accordance with the rules referred to above shall , where appropriate , be corrected to take into account also the incidence of national aid that the Kingdom of Spain is authorized to maintain under Article 80 .  </p><p>2 . No compensatory amount shall , however , be fixed if the application of paragraph 1 results in a minimal amount .  </p><p>3 . ( a ) In trade between Spain and the Community as at present constituted , compensatory amounts shall be levied by the importing State or granted by the exporting State .  </p><p> ( b ) In trade between Spain and third countries , levies or other import charges applied under the common agricultural policy , and , save for express derogation , export refunds , shall be reduced or increased , as the case may be , by the compensatory amounts applicable in trade with the Community as at present constituted .  </p><p>Customs duties may not , however , be reduced by the compensatory amount .  </p><p>4 . For products in respect of which the duty in the Common Customs Tariff is bound under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the binding shall be taken into account .  </p><p>5 . The compensatory amount levied or granted by a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 may not exceed the total amount levied by that same Member State on imports from third countries , benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause .  </p><p>The Council , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , may derogate from this rule , in particular in order to avoid deflections of trade and distortions of competition .  </p><p>6 . The Council , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , may derogate , in so far as is necessary for the proper functioning of the common agricultural policy , from the first subparagraph of Article 53 for products to which compensatory amounts apply .  </p>
