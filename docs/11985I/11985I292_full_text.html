<p>++++</p><p>Article 292  </p><p>1 . The Portuguese Republic shall apply , until 31 December 1990 and according to procedures to be determined , a mechanism for the control of :  </p><p> ( a ) the quantities of oil seeds and oil fruits , as well as of flour from which the oil has not been extracted and of all vegetable oils , with the exception of olive oil , intended for human consumption on the Portuguese domestic market , in order to avoid any worsening of the conditions for competition between the various vegetable oils . The volume of the quantities placed on the Portuguese market for consumption shall be established on the basis of consumption in Portugal and the level of this consumption will be assessed within the framework of a report drawn up for each marketing year according to the procedure provided for in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the basis of :  </p><p> - Portuguese consumption recorded over the period 1980 to 1983 ,  </p><p> - the foreseeable trend in demand .  </p><p>Following the same procedure , this report may be updated during the marketing year ;  </p><p> ( b ) the level of consumer prices for the vegetable oils referred to in paragraph ( a ) , in such a way as to maintain - until 31 December 1990 - in principle the price level , expressed in ECU , reached during the 1984/85 marketing year .  </p><p>The control mechanism referred to in paragraph ( a ) shall include the replacement , on 1 March 1986 , of the trade arrangements applied on imports into Portugal by a system of quantitative import restrictions opened without discrimination between economic operators , both with regard to the Community as at present constituted and with regard to third countries .  </p><p>2 . In exceptional circumstances , the control mechanism defined in this Article may be modified , for those products subjected to it , as far as necessary to avoid imbalances in the markets for the different oils .  </p><p>These modifications shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC .  </p>
