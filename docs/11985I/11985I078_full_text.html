<p>++++</p><p>Article 78  </p><p>1 . The component for protection of the processing industry which is used in calculating the charge on imports from third countries of products covered by the common organization of the markets in cereals and rice shall be levied on imports from Spain into the Community as at present constituted .  </p><p>2 . For imports into Spain , the amount of that component shall be determined by separating out , from the protection applied on 1 January 1985 , the component or components designed to ensure the protection of the processing industry ; however , this amount may not exceed the level of the Community protection component fixed for that product . If specific difficulties of quantification do not allow the determination of the protection component applicable in Spain , that Member State shall immediately apply the Community protection component .  </p><p>Such components shall be levied on imports from other Member States ; they shall replace , as regards the charge on imports from third countries , the Community protection component .  </p><p>3 . Article 75 shall apply to the component referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 , which shall be considered as the basic component . The reductions or alignments in question shall , however , be made in eight stages by 12,5 % at the beginning of the eight marketing years following accession fixed for the basic product concerned .  </p>
