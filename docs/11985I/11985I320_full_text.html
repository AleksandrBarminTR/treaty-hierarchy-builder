<p>++++</p><p>Article 320  </p><p>1 . The Portuguese Republic shall progressively adjust , during the first four years following accession , the monopoly held by EPAC for importing and marketing cereals in Portugal so as to ensure that , on expiry of the fourth year , no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States .  </p><p>2 . To that end , the Portuguese Republic shall adapt its rules referred to in Article 261 and may , notwithstanding Article 277 , apply to imports a system organized as follows :  </p><p> ( a ) Imports of cereals into Portugal shall be carried out as a percentage of the annual quantities imported during the preceding year at the following percentages by EPAC and by private operators respectively :  </p><p>Year * EPAC * Private operators *  </p><p>1986 * 80 % * 20 % *  </p><p>1987 * 60 % * 40 % *  </p><p>1988 * 40 % * 60 % *  </p><p>1989 * 20 % * 80 % *  </p><p>1990 * - * 100 % *  </p><p> ( b ) The imports referred to in ( a ) to be carried out by private operators shall be awarded by open tender without discrimination between economic operators .  </p><p>Within the framework of these invitations to tender , tenders relating to products of Community origin shall be corrected by :  </p><p> - the difference between the Community market prices and the world market price , and  </p><p> - an amount corresponding to a flat-rate preference equal to 5 ECU per tonne .  </p><p> ( c ) If imports of products of Community origin do not represent , per year , a minimum quantity of 15 % of the total quantity of cereals imported during that year , EPAC shall buy during the following year , in the Community as at present constituted , the quantity lacking in relation to the 15 % quantity referred to above . That quantity shall then be added to the obligatory purchase of 15 % for the new year .  </p><p>An intermediate estimate shall be drawn up at the end of the 1988/89 marketing year ; if it appears , on the basis of this estimate , that the obligatory purchase for 1989 is unlikely to be made , the necessary measures may be adopted in order to ensure compliance with that obligation .  </p>
