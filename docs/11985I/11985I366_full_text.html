These transitional measures shall be designed to ensure , after their expiry , the application by the Community of a single system for its relations with the co-contracting third countries as well as the identity of the rights and obligations of the Member States .  </p><p>3 . These transitional measures applicable to the countries listed in Article 368 shall not , in any field , result in the Portuguese Republic granting them more favourable treatment than will apply to the Community as at present constituted .  </p><p>In particular , all products subject to transitional measures in respect of quantitative restrictions applicable to the Community as at present constituted shall be subject to such measures vis-Ã -vis all the countries listed in Article 368 , and for an identical period of time subject to any specific derogations .  </p><p>4 . These transitional measures applicable to the countries listed in Article 368 shall not result in the Portuguese Republic giving less favourable treatment to those countries than to other third countries .
