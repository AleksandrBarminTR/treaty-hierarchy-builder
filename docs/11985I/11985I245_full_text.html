Until 31 December 1992 , the Portuguese Republic may apply quantitative restrictions to the import from third countries of products referred to in Annex XXI .  </p><p>2 . ( a ) The quantitative restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 shall consist of annual quotas opened without discrimination between economic operators .  </p><p> ( b ) The initial quota in 1986 for each product , expressed , as the case may be , in ECU , shall be fixed :  </p><p> - either at 3 % of the average of Portuguese annual production over the last three years before accession for which statistics are available ,  </p><p> - or at the average of Portuguese imports realized over the last three years before accession for which statistics are available , if this latter criterion were to lead to a higher volume or amount .  </p><p>3 . The minimum rate of progressive increase of the quotas shall be 20 % at the beginning of each year with respect to the quotas expressed in terms of value , and 15 % at the beginning of each year with respect to the quotas expressed in terms of volume .  </p><p>The increase shall be added to each quota and the subsequent increase shall be calculated on the basis of the total figure obtained .  </p><p>4 . Where imports made to Portugal over two consecutive years are less than 90 % of the annual quota opened , the quantitative restrictions in force in Portugal shall be abolished .  </p><p>5 . For the period 1 March to 31 December 1986 the applicable quota shall be equal to the initial quota reduced by one-sixth .  </p>
