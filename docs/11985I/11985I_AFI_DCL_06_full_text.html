<p>++++</p><p>Joint declaration  </p><p>on the adjustment of the &quot; acquis communautaire &quot; in the vegetable oils and fats sector  </p><p>Discussions on the adjustment of this &quot; acquis &quot; to the new situation of the Community as enlarged will be embarked upon as quickly as possible after accession .  </p><p>These discussions will take place on the basis of Commission proposals which will also take account of guidelines accepted by the Council in October 1983 with regard to olive oil and the development of the market in oils and fats . Should the existence of surpluses for olive oil or a genuine risk of the build-up of surpluses be ascertained , guarantee thresholds will be applied under the conditions indicated in the conclusions reached by the Council at its meeting in March 1984 , within the framework of the guidelines to be followed for the organization of the market in products which are witnessing or are likely to witness surplus production or a rapid increase in expenditure . These measures will take account of the repercussions of trade concessions in favour of third countries .  </p>
