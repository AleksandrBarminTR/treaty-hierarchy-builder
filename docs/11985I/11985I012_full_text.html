<p>++++</p><p>Article 12  </p><p>The following is substituted for Article 28 of the ECSC Treaty :  </p><p> &quot; Article 28  </p><p>When the Council is consulted by the High Authority , it shall consider the matter without necessarily taking a vote . The minutes of its proceedings shall be forwarded to the High Authority .  </p><p>Wherever this Treaty requires that the assent of the Council be given , that assent shall be considered to have been given if the proposal submitted by the High Authority receives the approval :  </p><p> - of an absolute majority of the representatives of the Member States , including the votes of the representatives of two Member States which each produce at least one-ninth of the total value of the coal and steel output of the Community , or  </p><p> - in the event of an equal division of votes and if the High Authority maintains its proposal after a second discussion , of the representatives of three Member States which each produce at least one-ninth of the total value of the coal and steel output of the Community .  </p><p>Wherever this Treaty requires a unanimous decision or unanimous assent , such decision or assent shall have been duly given if all the members of the Council vote in favour . However , for the purposes of applying Articles 21 , 32 , 32a , 78e and 78h of this Treaty , and Article 16 , the third paragraph of Article 20 , the fifth paragraph of Article 28 and Article 44 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice , abstention by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption by the Council of acts which require unanimity .  </p><p>Decisions of the Council , other than those for which a qualified majority or unanimity is required , shall be taken by a vote of the majority of its members ; this majority shall be considered to be attained if it represents an absolute majority of the representatives of the Member States , including the votes of the representatives of two Member States which each produce at least one-ninth of the total value of the coal and steel output of the Community . However , for the purpose of applying Articles 78 , 78b and 78e of this Treaty which require a qualified majority , the votes of the members of the Council are weighted as follows :  </p><p>Belgium : 5  </p><p>Denmark : 3  </p><p>Germany : 10  </p><p>Greece : 5  </p><p>Spain : 8  </p><p>France : 10  </p><p>Ireland : 3  </p><p>Italy : 10  </p><p>Luxembourg : 2  </p><p>Netherlands : 5  </p><p>Portugal : 5  </p><p>United Kingdom : 10  </p><p>For their adoption , acts shall require at least 54 votes in favour , cast by not less than eight members .  </p><p>Where a vote is taken , any member of the Council may act on behalf of not more than one other member .  </p><p>The Council shall deal with the Member States through its President .  </p><p>The acts of the Council shall be published in such a manner as it may decide . &quot;  </p>
