<p>++++</p><p>Article 338  </p><p>1 . A mechanism of regulatory amounts shall be set up for imports into the Community as at present constituted of the products referred to in paragraph 2 , coming from Portugal , for which reference prices are fixed in the context of the common organization of markets .  </p><p>2 . This mechanism shall be governed by the following rules :  </p><p> ( a ) For table wines , a regulatory amount equal to the difference which exists between the guide prices in Portugal and in the Community as at present constituted shall be levied . However , the level of this amount may be adjusted , according to the procedure provided for in Article 67 of Regulation  ( EEC ) No 337/79 , to take account of the situation of market prices assessed in accordance with the different wine categories and on the basis of their quality .  </p><p> ( b ) For certain wines of designated origin and for other products likely to create disturbances on the market , a regulatory amount may be fixed according to the procedure provided for under ( a ) . This regulatory amount shall be derived from that applicable to table wines according to procedures to be determined .  </p><p>3 . A ceiling level shall be fixed for the regulatory amount ensuring conditions of treatment not less favourable than those in force under the arrangements prior to accession . To that end , this amount shall be calculated so that the amount obtained by increasing the guide price applicable in Portugal for the product in question by the regulatory amount and the customs duties which are applicable to it shall not exceed the reference price in force for that product during the wine-growing year in question .  </p><p>4 . In view of the special situation of the market in the different products referred to in paragraph 2 , it may be decided , in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 67 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 337/79 , to fix a regulatory amount for exports of one or more of those products from the Community as at present constituted to Portugal .  </p><p>This amount shall be fixed at a level such as will ensure a normal pattern of trade between the Community as at present constituted and Portugal , that will not cause disturbances on the Portuguese market for the products in question .  </p><p>5 . The regulatory amount granted shall be financed by the Community by means of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund .  </p>
