<p>++++</p><p>Article 48  </p><p>1 . Without prejudice to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article , the Kingdom of Spain shall , from 1 January 1986 , progressively adjust State monopolies of a commercial character within the meaning of Article 37 ( 1 ) of EEC Treaty , bearing in mind , where appropriate , Article 90 ( 2 ) of the EEC Treaty , so as to ensure that by 31 December 1991 at the latest no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States .  </p><p>The present Member States shall have equivalent obligations in relation to the Kingdom of Spain .  </p><p>The Commission shall make recommendations as to the manner in which and the timetable according to which the adjustment must be carried out , it being understood that the manner and timetable must be the same for the Kingdom of Spain and the present Member States .  </p><p>2 . The Kingdom of Spain shall , from 1 January 1986 , abolish all exclusive export rights .  </p><p>3 . With regard to products indicated in the list appearing in Annex V , the exclusive import rights shall be abolished not later than 31 December 1991 . The abolition of these exclusive rights shall be made by progressively opening , from 1 January 1986 , import quotas for products from the present Member States . Quota volumes for 1986 are indicated in the said list .  </p><p>The Kingdom of Spain shall increase the quota volumes in the manner set out in the annex referred to in the first subparagraph .  </p><p>The increases expressed in percentage terms shall be added to each quota and the next increase calculated on the basis of the total thus obtained .  </p><p>The quotas referred to in the first subparagraph shall be opened for all operators without restriction and goods imported under these quotas may not be subject in Spain to exclusive marketing rights at the wholesale level ; as regards retail sales of certain goods imported under quotas , the marketing of such goods to consumers will have to be on a non-discriminatory basis .  </p><p>4 . The adjustment of the monopoly of products indicated in the list appearing in Annex VI may not necessarily affect the functioning of the Spanish petroleum monopoly with regard to third countries . This monopoly may continue to determine the origin and the conditions of acquisition of a share of crude oil imports , from third countries , necessary to ensure availability of supply on the Spanish market , whilst complying with the provisions of the EEC Treaty , and in particular those relating to free movement contained in Articles 30 and 37 of that Treaty .  </p>
