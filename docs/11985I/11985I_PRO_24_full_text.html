<p>++++</p><p>Protocol 24  </p><p>on agricultural structures in Portugal  </p><p>1 . As from the date of accession , joint action shall be embarked upon in favour of Portugal , in accordance with the objectives of the common agricultural policy , comprising a specific development programme adapted to the special structural conditions of Portuguese agriculture . The programme , which shall extend over a total period of 10 years , shall have as its particular objectives the substantial improvement of production and marketing conditions together with an improvement in the structural situation of the Portuguese agricultural sector as a whole .  </p><p>2 . The Community shall implement this programme of action in favour of Portugal in a manner on a par with measures already in existence in the Community for its least favoured areas . This programme will be directed towards developing rural infrastructures , agricultural advisory services and the possibilities for vocational training and will contribute towards the reorientation of production , including irrigation , when this proves necessary , drainage and field improvement works .  </p><p>Furthermore , the Community shall implement the programme in such a way as to meet specifically the needs and special situation of Portugal . The programme shall include , in particular , measures , still to be defined , intended to contribute efficiently to the cessation of activities . At all events , these measures may not be less favourable than those enjoyed by the Member States of the Community as at present constituted , and the conditions for eligibility for Community financing must be adapted to the specific features of the situation in Portugal .  </p><p>3 . The Community will contribute to the desirable objective of the development of agricultural structures in Portugal with a view to attaining objectives in the short , medium and long term as follows :  </p><p> ( a ) short term : improving agricultural advisory services and existing farming conditions by better distribution of available resources , without this entailing a change in the size of holdings or large-scale rationalization measures ; improving , moreover , processing and marketing plants as far as possible , bearing in mind the dominant features , or the features as envisaged , of agricultural production ;  </p><p> ( b ) medium term : developing a sound infrastructure and the irrigation of areas of dry cultivation , encouraging better use of land and laying down and developing efficient measures for agricultural advisory services , training for agriculture and agricultural research . In this context , the more long-term aspects of cattle improvement could also be considered , such as performance testing and progeny testing of male breeding animals ;  </p><p> ( c ) long term : this would consist essentially of promoting the reparcelling of holdings which have been split up and the enlargement of holdings which are not viable at the moment . At the same time an endeavour should be made to correct the imbalance in the age pyramid of the farming population by encouraging elderly farmers to retire and , where appropriate , by implementing measures , aimed at making it easier for young people to join the profession under conditions which offer a guarantee as to the long-term viability of their holding .  </p><p>4 . The total estimated cost to be borne by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund , Guidance Section , for application of the specific programme covering in particular the desolate regions of Portugal , including those of the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira , shall be in the order of 700 million ECU for its 10 year application period , i.e . in the order of 70 million ECU each year .  </p><p>5 . The rate of Community financing of the expenditure eligible under the specific programme shall be fixed with account being taken of the rates which have been , are or will be applied to the least favoured regions of the Community for similar measures .  </p><p>6 . The Council , acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , shall adopt , under the conditions provided for in Article 258 of the Act of Accession , the procedures for the specific programme .  </p><p>7 . Before 1 January 1991 , the Commission shall present the Council with an appraisal report on the execution of the specific programme .  </p>
