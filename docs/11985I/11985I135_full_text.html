<p>++++</p><p>Article 135  </p><p>During the first phase , the Kingdom of Spain shall apply the following disciplines :  </p><p>1 . A price discipline :  </p><p> ( a ) The Kingdom of Spain shall fix , on accession , institutional prices for the products for which common prices exist in accordance with criteria that are as close as possible to those defined under the common organization of markets on the basis of a reference period to be determined at a level corresponding to economic realities .  </p><p> ( b ) Where these Spanish prices , expressed in ECU , are less than or equal to the common prices , the annual price increases may not , as a rule , exceed in value the increase in common prices .  </p><p>In no event may the Spanish prices exceed the level of common prices .  </p><p> ( c ) Where the Spanish prices , expressed in ECU , are higher than the common prices , they may not be increased in relation to their previous level . Furthermore the Kingdom of Spain shall adjust its prices to the extent necessary to avoid an increase in the variation between its prices and the common prices .  </p><p> ( d ) The Kingdom of Spain may adjust its prices where market interventions reach an unjustified volume . In that case the adjusted price shall replace the original price for the application of the rules appearing in ( b ) and ( c ) .  </p><p> ( e ) The Commission shall ensure the observance of the rules referred to above . Any overrun of the price level resulting from the application of these rules shall not be taken into consideration for the determination of the price level to be adopted as the starting level for moves towards price alignment during the second phase referred to in Article 148 .  </p><p>2 . An aid discipline :  </p><p>Under this discipline , the Kingdom of Spain shall be authorized to maintain its national aid during the first phase .  </p><p>However , during that period , the Kingdom of Spain shall ensure that a certain dismantling of national aids which do not comply with Community law takes place and that the Community aid plan is progressively introduced in the organization of its domestic market without the level of such aids exceeding the common level .  </p><p>3 . A production discipline :  </p><p>Under this discipline , the Kingdom of Spain shall apply the same production disciplines as those which are , where appropriate , applicable in the other Member States or in those Member States which find themselves in a comparable situation with regard to such a discipline .  </p>
