Except for products falling within Annex II of the EEC Treaty and subject to the provisions of this Protocol , Spain and Portugal shall apply in their trade the treatment agreed upon between each of them , on the one hand , and the Community as at present constituted , on the other , as such treatment is defined in Chapter 1 of Title II and in Chapter 1 of Title III of Part Four of the Act of Accession .  </p><p>2 . The Kingdom of Spain shall apply to products originating in Portugal and falling within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Common Customs Tariff , with the exception of those falling within Regulations ( EEC ) No 2783/75 ,  ( EEC ) No 3033/80 and ( EEC ) No 3035/80 , the same arrangements as those applied by the Community as at present constituted , with regard to Portugal , in particular with reference to the elimination of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports , and measures having equivalent effect , to goods falling within the EEC Treaty and fulfilling , in Portugal , the conditions of Articles 9 and 10 of the said Treaty and to goods falling within the ECSC Treaty which are in free circulation , in accordance with this Treaty , in Portugal .  </p><p>The Portuguese Republic shall apply to products originating in Spain falling within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Common Customs Tariff , with the exception of those falling within Regulations ( EEC ) No 2783/75 , ( EEC ) No 3033/80 and ( EEC ) No 3035/80 , the same treatment as it applies with respect to the Community as at present constituted .  </p><p>3 . The Council , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , shall adopt before 1 March 1986 the rules of origin applicable to the trade between Spain and Portugal .  </p><p>Article 2  </p><p>For the purposes of applying Article 48 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession , with regard to the products listed in Annex A , the abolition of exclusive import duties in Spain provided for in paragraph 3 of the said Article shall be carried out by the progressive opening , as from 1 March 1986 , of import quotas for products originating in Portugal . The amounts of the quotas for 1986 shall be indicated in the said list .  </p><p>The Kingdom of Spain shall increase the amounts of the quotas under the conditions given in the same Annex . Increases expressed in percentages shall be added to each quota and the following increase shall be calculated on the basis of the total figure thus obtained .  </p><p>Article 3  </p><p>1 . By way of derogation from Article 1 , the Kingdom of Spain shall introduce , for products originating in Portugal and listed in Annex B , from 1 March 1986 to 31 December 1990 , zero rate tariff ceilings . Should the quantities provided for each of the said ceilings be attained , the Kingdom of Spain may , until the end of the current calendar year , reintroduce customs duties ; in this event these customs duties shall be identical to those which it applies at the same time to the Community as at present constituted .  </p><p>The amount of the ceilings for 1986 shall be indicated in Annex B and the rate at which the annual progressive increase is carried out shall be the following :  </p><p> - 1987 , 10 % ,  </p><p> - 1988 , 12 % ,  </p><p> - 1989 , 14 % ,  </p><p> - 1990 , 16 % .  </p><p>The increase shall be added to each quota and the subsequent increase shall be calculated on the basis of the total figure obtained .  </p><p>2 . The arrangements for the tariff ceilings provided for in paragraph 1 will also be applicable for 1990 to the textile products which appear in Annex C .  </p><p>3 . The Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic may , until 31 December 1990 , submit the imports of products appearing in Annex B to prior monitoring for purely statistical purposes .  </p><p>The Kingdom of Spain may submit the imports of products referred to in Annex C during 1990 to prior monitoring for purely statistical purposes .  </p><p>At all events , the import of the products referred to above may not be held up in any way as a result of the application of this statistical monitoring .  </p><p>Article 4  </p><p>1 . Until 31 December 1990 , the Kingdom of Spain may subject to prior monitoring on import , purely for statistical purposes , the following products originating in Portugal :  </p><p>CCT heading No * Description *  </p><p>47.01 * Pulp derived by mechanical or chemical means from any fibrous vegetable material *  </p><p>48.01 * Paper or paperboard ( including cellulose wadding ) , in rolls or sheets *  </p><p>At all events , the import of the products referred to above may not be held up in any way as a result of the application of this statistical monitoring .  </p><p>2 .

Where there is no agreement , and at the request of one of the two States , the Commission may decide to extend the arrangement if it notes that there are major disturbances on the Portuguese market .  </p><p>2 . Under the conditions provided for in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 , the Portuguese Republic may , until 31 December 1992 , submit to prior monitoring on import , purely for statistical purposes , the following products originating in Spain :  </p><p>CCT heading No * Description *  </p><p>22.02 * Lemonade , flavoured spa waters and flavoured aerated waters , and other non-alcoholic beverages , not including fruit and vegetable juices falling within heading No 20.07 *  </p><p>22.03 * Beer made from malt *  </p><p>3 .

Until 31 December 1990 and for the products referred to in Article 4 , where there are abrupt and major changes in their traditional trade patterns , the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall consult , within a maximum of five working days from the date of request made by one of these Member States to examine the situation , in order to arrive at an agreement on the possible measures to be adopted .  </p><p>2 . Until 31 December 1988 and for the products referred to in Article 5 ( 1 ) , where there are abrupt and major changes in the import into Portugal of products originating in Spain , the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall consult each other , within a maximum of five working days from the date on which the request by the Kingdom of Spain , to examine the situation , is received , in order to arrive at an agreement on the possible measures to be adopted .  </p><p>3 . Should it prove impossible , in the consultations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 , for the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to arrive at an agreement , the Commission , bearing in mind the criteria governing the safeguard clause referred to in Article 379 of the Act of Accession , shall , by an emergency procedure lay down the safeguard measures which it deems necessary , defining the conditions and means of application .  </p><p>Article 7  </p><p>1 . In cases where the compensatory amounts referred to in Articles 72 and 240 of the Act of Accession or the compensatory amounts mechanism referred to in Article 270 are applied in trade between Spain and Portugal to one or more of the commodities considered as having been used in the manufacture of goods covered by Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 3033/80 of 11 November 1980 fixing the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products , the transitional measures applicable shall be determined in accordance with the rules laid down in Articles 53 and 213 of that Act . The compensatory amounts applicable in trade between the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall be levied or granted by the State in which the prices of the agricultural commodities concerned are the higher .  </p><p>2 . The customs duty constituting the fixed component in the taxation applicable , on the date of accession , to imports to Portugal from Spain and vice versa of goods covered by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3033/80 , shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 53 and 213 of the Act of Accession .  </p><p>However , in cases where , for the products listed in Annex XIX of that Act , the customs duty constituting the fixed component in the taxation applicable by Portugal to imports from Spain , calculated according to the above provisions , is less than the duties given in that Annex , the latter shall apply .  </p><p>In cases where , for these same products , this customs duty is higher than the customs duty constituting the fixed component of the taxation applicable by Portugal to imports from the Community as at present constituted , the latter shall apply .  </p><p>The previous paragraph shall not apply to chocolate and other food preparations containing cocoa of heading No 18.06 of the Common Customs Tariff . In respect of such products , the fixed component in the taxation applicable by Portugal to imports from Spain may not be higher than 30 % .  </p><p>Article 8  </p><p>1 . The Commission , taking due account of the provisions in force , in particular those relating to Community transit , shall determine the methods of administrative cooperation designed to ensure that the goods fulfilling the conditions required for that purpose benefit from the treatment laid down by this Protocol .  </p><p>These methods will include inter alia the measures necessary to ensure that goods which have benefited from the above treatment in Spain or Portugal , at the time of their further dispatch to the Community as at present constituted , are subject to the same treatment as that which would have been applicable to them had they been imported directly .  </p><p>2 . Until 28 February 1986 , the arrangements currently governing trade relations between the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall remain applicable to trade between Spain and Portugal .  </p><p>3 . The Commission shall determine the provisions applicable from 1 March 1986 to trade , between Spain and Portugal , in goods obtained in Spain or Portugal , in the manufacture of which were used :  </p><p> - products which have not been subject to the customs duties and charges having equivalent effect which were applicable to them in Spain or Portugal , or which have benefited from a total or partial refund of such duties or charges ,  </p><p> - agricultural products which do not satisfy the conditions required to be admitted for free circulation in Spain or Portugal .  </p><p>In adopting these provisions , the Commission shall take account of the rules laid down in the Act of Accession for the elimination of customs duties between the Community as at present constituted and Spain and Portugal and for the gradual application , by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic , of the Common Customs Tariff and of the provisions relating to the common agricultural policy .  </p><p>Article 9  </p><p>1 . Unless the Act of Accession and this Protocol provide otherwise , the customs legislation in force relating to trade with third countries shall apply under the same conditions to trade between Spain and Portugal , for as long as customs duties are levied in respect of such trade .  </p><p>For fixing the customs valuation in trade between Spain and Portugal , and in trade with third countries until :  </p><p> - 31 December 1992 in the case of industrial products .  </p><p> - 31 December 1995 in the case of agricultural products ,  </p><p>the customs territory to be taken into consideration shall be that defined by the legislation in force in the Kingdom of Spain and in the Portuguese Republic on 31 December 1985 .  </p><p>2 . In their trade , the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall apply , as from 1 March 1986 , the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff and that of the ECSC unified tariff .  </p><p>Article 10  </p><p>The Portuguese Republic shall apply , in the context of its trade with the Canary Islands and Ceuta and Melilla , the specific arrangements agreed therefor between the Community as at present constituted and the Kingdom of Spain and referred to in Protocol 2 .  </p><p>Article 11  </p><p>Without prejudice to the second subparagraph of Article 1 ( 2 ) the Commission shall on accession adopt every measure of application which may prove necessary with a view to implementing the provisions of this Protocol , and in particular the procedures for applying the monitoring referred to in Articles 3 , 4 and 5 .  </p><p>ANNEX A  </p><p>List provided for in Article 2 of Protocol 3  </p><p>Quota No * CCT heading No * Description * Basic quota ( 1986 ) * Annual rate of increase ( % ) *  </p><p>1 * 24.02 * Manufactured tobacco ; tobacco extracts and essences : * 300 000 000 units * 20 *  </p><p> * * A .
