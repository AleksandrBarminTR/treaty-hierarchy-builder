Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.</p><p>2. The Commission shall monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of government debt in the Member States with a view to identifying gross errors. In particular it shall examine compliance with budgetary discipline on the basis of the following two criteria:</p><p>(a)  whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless</p><p>-  either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value;</p><p>-  or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value;</p><p>(b)  whether the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.</p><p>The reference values are specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to this Treaty.</p><p>3. If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both of these criteria, the Commission shall prepare a report.

If the decision has been taken to set the date in accordance with Article 109j(3), the Council shall, on the basis of its recommendations referred to in Article 109j(2), acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, decide whether any, and if so which, Member States shall have a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States shall in this Treaty be referred to as &quot;Member States with a derogation&quot;.</p><p>If the Council has confirmed which Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, in accordance with Article 109j(4), those Member States which do not fulfil the conditions shall have a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States shall in this Treaty be referred to as &quot;Member States with a derogation&quot;.</p><p>2. At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 109j(1). After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or of Government, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 109j(1), and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned.</p><p>3. A derogation referred to in paragraph 1 shall entail that the following Articles do not apply to the Member State concerned:</p><p>Articles 104c(9) and (11), 105(1), (2), (3) and  (5), 105a, 108a, 109, and 109a(2)(b).

In Articles 105(1), (2) and (3), 105a, 108a, 109 and 109a(2)(b), &quot;Member States&quot; shall be read as &quot;Member States without a derogation&quot;.</p><p>5. The voting rights of Member States with a derogation shall be suspended for the Council decisions referred to in the Articles of this Treaty mentioned in paragraph 3. In that case, by way of derogation from Articles 148 and 189a(1), a qualified majority shall be defined as two thirds of the votes of the representatives of the Member States without a derogation weighted in accordance with Article 148(2), and unanimity of those Member States shall be required for an act requiring unanimity.</p><p>6.

If there are Member States with a derogation, the number of members of the Executive Board may be smaller than provided for in Article 11.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, but in no circumstances shall it be less than four.</p><p>As soon as the Executive Board is appointed, the ESCB and the ECB shall be established and shall prepare for their full operation as described in this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The full exercise of their powers shall start from the first day of the third stage.</p><p>2. As soon as the ECB is established, it shall, if necessary, take over tasks of the EMI. The EMI shall go into liquidation upon the establishment of the ECB; the modalities of liquidation are laid down in the Statute of the EMI.</p><p>3. If and as long as there are Member States with a derogation, and without prejudice to Article 106(3) of this Treaty, the General Council of the ECB referred to in Article 45 of the Statute of the ESCB shall be constituted as a third decision-making body of the ECB.</p><p>4. At the starting date of the third stage, the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States without a derogation, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt the conversion rates at which their currencies shall be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed rate the ECU shall be substituted for these currencies, and the ECU will become a currency in its own right. This measure shall by itself not modify the external value of the ECU. The Council shall, acting according to the same procedure, also take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the ECU as the single currency of those Member States.</p><p>5. If it is decided, according to the procedure set out in  Article 109k(2), to abrogate a derogation, the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States without a derogation and the Member State concerned, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt the rate at which the ECU shall be substituted for the currency of the Member State concerned, and take the other measures necessary for the introduction of the ECU as the single currency in the Member State concerned.</p><p>Article 109m</p><p>1. Until the beginning of the third stage, each Member State shall treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest. In so doing, Member States shall take account of the experience acquired in cooperation within the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) and in developing the ECU, and shall respect existing powers in this field.</p><p>2. From the beginning of the third stage and for as long as a Member State has a derogation, paragraph 1 shall apply by analogy to the exchange rate policy of that Member State.&#039;</p><p></p><p>26)  In Title II of Part Three, the title of Chapter 4 shall be replaced by the following:</p><p>&#039;TITLE VII COMMON COMMERCIAL POLICY&#039;</p><p></p><p>27) Article 111 shall be repealed.</p><p></p><p>28) Article 113 shall be replaced by the following:</p><p>&#039;Article 113</p><p>1.
