<p>Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts - Part one - Substantive amendments - Article 2.22</p><p>The Treaty establishing the European Community shall be amended in accordance with the provisions of this Article.</p><p>Articles 117 to 120 shall be replaced by the following Articles:</p><p>&#039;Article 117</p><p>The Community and the Member States, having in mind fundamental social rights such as those set out in the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion.</p><p>To this end the Community and the Member States shall implement measures which take account of the diverse forms of national practices, in particular in the field of contractual relations, and the need to maintain the competitiveness of the Community economy.</p><p>They believe that such a development will ensue not only from the functioning of the common market, which will favour the harmonisation of social systems, but also from the procedures provided for in this Treaty and from the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action.</p><p>Article 118</p><p>1.  With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 117, the Community shall support and complement the activities of the Member States in the following fields:</p><p>- improvement in particular of the working environment to protect workers&#039; health and safety;</p><p>- working conditions;</p><p>- the information and consultation of workers;</p><p>- the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article 127;</p><p>- equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work.</p><p>2.  To this end, the Council may adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for gradual implementation, having regard to the conditions and technical rules obtaining in each of the Member States. Such directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.</p><p>The Council shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.</p><p>The Council, acting in accordance with the same procedure, may adopt measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences in order to combat social exclusion.</p><p>3.  However, the Council shall act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in the following areas:</p><p>- social security and social protection of workers;</p><p>- protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated;</p><p>- representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers, including co-determination, subject to paragraph 6;</p><p>- conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Community territory;</p><p>- financial contributions for promotion of employment and job-creation, without prejudice to the provisions relating to the Social Fund.</p><p>4.  A Member State may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the implementation of directives adopted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3.</p><p>In this case, it shall ensure that, no later than the date on which a directive must be transposed in accordance with Article 189, management and labour have introduced the necessary measures by agreement, the Member State concerned being required to take any necessary measure enabling it at any time to be in a position to guarantee the results imposed by that directive.</p><p>5.  The provisions adopted pursuant to this Article shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures compatible with this Treaty.</p><p>6.  The provisions of this Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs.</p><p>Article 118a</p><p>1.  The Commission shall have the task of promoting the consultation of management and labour at Community level and shall take any relevant measure to facilitate their dialogue by ensuring balanced support for the parties.</p><p>2.  To this end, before submitting proposals in the social policy field, the Commission shall consult management and labour on the possible direction of Community action.</p><p>3.  If, after such consultation, the Commission considers Community action advisable, it shall consult management and labour on the content of the envisaged proposal. Management and labour shall forward to the Commission an opinion or, where appropriate, a recommendation.</p><p>4.  On the occasion of such consultation, management and labour may inform the Commission of their wish to initiate the process provided for in Article 118b. The duration of the procedure shall not exceed nine months, unless the management and labour concerned and the Commission decide jointly to extend it.</p><p>Article 118b</p><p>1.  Should management and labour so desire, the dialogue between them at Community level may lead to contractual relations, including agreements.</p><p>2.  Agreements concluded at Community level shall be implemented either in accordance with the procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters covered by Article 118, at the joint request of the signatory parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission.</p><p>The Council shall act by qualified majority, except where the agreement in question contains one or more provisions relating to one of the areas referred to in Article 118(3), in which case it shall act unanimously.</p><p>Article 118c</p><p>With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 117 and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty, the Commission shall encourage cooperation between the Member States and facilitate the coordination of their action in all social policy fields under this chapter, particularly in matters relating to:</p><p>- employment;</p><p>- labour law and working conditions;</p><p>- basic and advanced vocational training;</p><p>- social security;</p><p>- prevention of occupational accidents and diseases;</p><p>- occupational hygiene;</p><p>- the right of association and collective bargaining between employers and workers.</p><p>To this end, the Commission shall act in close contact with Member States by making studies, delivering opinions and arranging consultations both on problems arising at national level and on those of concern to international organisations.</p><p>Before delivering the opinions provided for in this Article, the Commission shall consult the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>Article 119</p><p>1.  Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.</p><p>2.  For the purpose of this Article, &quot;payÂ¨ means the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of his employment, from his employer.</p><p>Equal pay without discrimination based on sex means:</p><p>(a) that pay for the same work at piece rates shall be calculated on the basis of the same unit of measurement;</p><p>(b) that pay for work at time rates shall be the same for the same job.</p><p>3.  The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b, and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, shall adopt measures to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, including the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.</p><p>4.  With a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.</p><p>Article 119a</p><p>Member States shall endeavour to maintain the existing equivalence between paid holiday schemes.</p><p>Article 120</p><p>The Commission shall draw up a report each year on progress in achieving the objectives of Article 117, including the demographic situation in the Community. It shall forward the report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>The European Parliament may invite the Commission to draw up reports on particular problems concerning the social situation.`</p><p>  </p>
