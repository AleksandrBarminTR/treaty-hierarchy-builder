The Union shall define and implement a common foreign and security policy covering all areas of foreign and security policy, the objectives of which shall be:</p><p>- to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter;</p><p>- to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways;</p><p>- to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders;</p><p>- to promote international cooperation;</p><p>- to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>2.  The Member States shall support the Union&#039;s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.</p><p>The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity. They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.</p><p>The Council shall ensure that these principles are complied with.</p><p>Article J.2</p><p>The Union shall pursue the objectives set out in Article J.1 by:</p><p>- defining the principles of and general guidelines for the common foreign and security policy;</p><p>- deciding on common strategies;</p><p>- adopting joint actions;</p><p>- adopting common positions;</p><p>- strengthening systematic cooperation between Member States in the conduct of policy.</p><p>Article J.3</p><p>1.  The European Council shall define the principles of and general guidelines for the common foreign and security policy, including for matters with defence implications.</p><p>2.  The European Council shall decide on common strategies to be implemented by the Union in areas where the Member States have important interests in common.</p><p>Common strategies shall set out their objectives, duration and the means to be made available by the Union and the Member States.</p><p>3.  The Council shall take the decisions necessary for defining and implementing the common foreign and security policy on the basis of the general guidelines defined by the European Council.</p><p>The Council shall recommend common strategies to the European Council and shall implement them, in particular by adopting joint actions and common positions.</p><p>The Council shall ensure the unity, consistency and effectiveness of action by the Union.</p><p>Article J.4</p><p>1.  The Council shall adopt joint actions. Joint actions shall address specific situations where operational action by the Union is deemed to be required. They shall lay down their objectives, scope, the means to be made available to the Union, if necessary their duration, and the conditions for their implementation.</p><p>2.  If there is a change in circumstances having a substantial effect on a question subject to joint action, the Council shall review the principles and objectives of that action and take the necessary decisions. As long as the Council has not acted, the joint action shall stand.</p><p>3.  Joint actions shall commit the Member States in the positions they adopt and in the conduct of their activity.</p><p>4.  The Council may request the Commission to submit to it any appropriate proposals relating to the common foreign and security policy to ensure the implementation of a joint action.</p><p>5.  Whenever there is any plan to adopt a national position or take national action pursuant to a joint action, information shall be provided in time to allow, if necessary, for prior consultations within the Council. The obligation to provide prior information shall not apply to measures which are merely a national transposition of Council decisions.</p><p>6.  In cases of imperative need arising from changes in the situation and failing a Council decision, Member States may take the necessary measures as a matter of urgency having regard to the general objectives of the joint action. The Member State concerned shall inform the Council immediately of any such measures.</p><p>7.  Should there be any major difficulties in implementing a joint action, a Member State shall refer them to the Council which shall discuss them and seek appropriate solutions. Such solutions shall not run counter to the objectives of the joint action or impair its effectiveness.</p><p>Article J.5</p><p>The Council shall adopt common positions. Common positions shall define the approach of the Union to a particular matter of a geographical or thematic nature. Member States shall ensure that their national policies conform to the common positions.</p><p>Article J.6</p><p>Member States shall inform and consult one another within the Council on any matter of foreign and security policy of general interest in order to ensure that the Union&#039;s influence is exerted as effectively as possible by means of concerted and convergent action.</p><p>Article J.7</p><p>1.  The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p><p>The Western European Union (WEU) is an integral part of the development of the Union providing the Union with access to an operational capability notably in the context of paragraph 2. It supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the common foreign and security policy as set out in this Article. The Union shall accordingly foster closer institutional relations with the WEU with a view to the possibility of the integration of the WEU into the Union, should the European Council so decide. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p><p>The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</p><p>The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as Member States consider appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments.</p><p>2.  Questions referred to in this Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.</p><p>3.  The Union will avail itself of the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.</p><p>The competence of the European Council to establish guidelines in accordance with Article J.3 shall also obtain in respect of the WEU for those matters for which the Union avails itself of the WEU.</p><p>When the Union avails itself of the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions of the Union on the tasks referred to in paragraph 2 all Member States of the Union shall be entitled to participate fully in the tasks in question. The Council, in agreement with the institutions of the WEU, shall adopt the necessary practical arrangements to allow all Member States contributing to the tasks in question to participate fully and on an equal footing in planning and decision taking in the WEU.</p><p>Decisions having defence implications dealt with under this paragraph shall be taken without prejudice to the policies and obligations referred to in paragraph 1, third subparagraph.</p><p>4.  The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the WEU and the Atlantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this Title.</p><p>5.  With a view to furthering the objectives of this Article, the provisions of this Article will be reviewed in accordance with Article N.</p><p>Article J.8</p><p>1.  The Presidency shall represent the Union in matters coming within the common foreign and security policy.</p><p>2.  The Presidency shall be responsible for the implementation of decisions taken under this Title; in that capacity it shall in principle express the position of the Union in international organisations and international conferences.</p><p>3.  The Presidency shall be assisted by the Secretary-General of the Council who shall exercise the function of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy.</p><p>4.  The Commission shall be fully associated in the tasks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The Presidency shall be assisted in those tasks if need be by the next Member State to hold the Presidency.</p><p>5.  The Council may, whenever it deems it necessary, appoint a special representative with a mandate in relation to particular policy issues.</p><p>Article J.9</p><p>1.  Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences. They shall uphold the common positions in such fora.</p><p>In international organisations and at international conferences where not all the Member States participate, those which do take part shall uphold the common positions.</p><p>2.  Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and Article J.4(3), Member States represented in international organisations or international conferences where not all the Member States participate shall keep the latter informed of any matter of common interest.</p><p>Member States which are also members of the United Nations Security Council will concert and keep the other Member States fully informed. Member States which are permanent members of the Security Council will, in the execution of their functions, ensure the defence of the positions and the interests of the Union, without prejudice to their responsibilities under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.</p><p>Article J.10</p><p>The diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States and the Commission Delegations in third countries and international conferences, and their representations to international organisations, shall cooperate in ensuring that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council are complied with and implemented.</p><p>They shall step up cooperation by exchanging information, carrying out joint assessments and contributing to the implementation of the provisions referred to in Article 8c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p><p>Article J.11</p><p>The Presidency shall consult the European Parliament on the main aspects and the basic choices of the common foreign and security policy and shall ensure that the views of the European Parliament are duly taken into consideration. The European Parliament shall be kept regularly informed by the Presidency and the Commission of the development of the Union&#039;s foreign and security policy.</p><p>The European Parliament may ask questions of the Council or make recommendations to it. It shall hold an annual debate on progress in implementing the common foreign and security policy.</p><p>Article J.12</p><p>1.  Any Member State or the Commission may refer to the Council any questions relating to the common foreign and security policy and may submit proposals to the Council.</p><p>2.

Decisions under this Title shall be taken by the Council acting unanimously. Abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of such decisions.</p><p>When abstaining in a vote, any member of the Council may qualify its abstention by making a formal declaration under the present subparagraph. In that case, it shall not be obliged to apply the decision, but shall accept that the decision commits the Union. In a spirit of mutual solidarity, the Member State concerned shall refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the other Member States shall respect its position. If the members of the Council qualifying their abstention in this way represent more than one third of the votes weighted in accordance with Article 148(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the decision shall not be adopted.</p><p>2.  By derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, the Council shall act by qualified majority:</p><p>- when adopting joint actions, common positions or taking any other decision on the basis of a common strategy;</p><p>- when adopting any decision implementing a joint action or a common position.</p><p>If a member of the Council declares that, for important and stated reasons of national policy, it intends to oppose the adoption of a decision to be taken by qualified majority, a vote shall not be taken. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, request that the matter be referred to the European Council for decision by unanimity.</p><p>The votes of the members of the Council shall be weighted in accordance with Article 148(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. For their adoption, decisions shall require at least 62 votes in favour, cast by at least 10 members.</p><p>This paragraph shall not apply to decisions having military or defence implications.</p><p>3.  For procedural questions, the Council shall act by a majority of its members.</p><p>Article J.14</p><p>When it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States or international organisations in implementation of this Title, the Council, acting unanimously, may authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission as appropriate, to open negotiations to that effect. Such agreements shall be concluded by the Council acting unanimously on a recommendation from the Presidency. No agreement shall be binding on a Member State whose representative in the Council states that it has to comply with the requirements of its own constitutional procedure; the other members of the Council may agree that the agreement shall apply provisionally to them.</p><p>The provisions of this Article shall also apply to matters falling under Title VI.</p><p>Article J.15</p><p>Without prejudice to Article 151 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a Political Committee shall monitor the international situation in the areas covered by the common foreign and security policy and contribute to the definition of policies by delivering opinions to the Council at the request of the Council or on its own initiative. It shall also monitor the implementation of agreed policies, without prejudice to the responsibility of the Presidency and the Commission.</p><p>Article J.16</p><p>The Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, shall assist the Council in matters coming within the scope of the common foreign and security policy, in particular through contributing to the formulation, preparation and implementation of policy decisions, and, when appropriate and acting on behalf of the Council at the request of the Presidency, through conducting political dialogue with third parties.</p><p>Article J.17</p><p>The Commission shall be fully associated with the work carried out in the common foreign and security policy field.</p><p>Article J.18</p><p>1.  Articles 137, 138, 139 to 142, 146, 147, 150 to 153, 157 to 163, 191a and 217 of the Treaty establishing the European Community shall apply to the provisions relating to the areas referred to in this Title.</p><p>2.  Administrative expenditure which the provisions relating to the areas referred to in this Title entail for the institutions shall be charged to the budget of the European Communities.</p><p>3.  Operational expenditure to which the implementation of those provisions gives rise shall also be charged to the budget of the European Communities, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise.</p><p>In cases where expenditure is not charged to the budget of the European Communities it shall be charged to the Member States in accordance with the gross national product scale, unless the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise. As for expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications, Member States whose representatives in the Council have made a formal declaration under Article J.13(1), second subparagraph, shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing thereof.</p><p>4.  The budgetary procedure laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community shall apply to the expenditure charged to the budget of the European Communities.`</p><p>  </p>
