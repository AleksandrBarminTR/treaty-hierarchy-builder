<p>III. OTHER DECLARATIONS</p><p></p><p></p><p>A. Joint Declarations: The present Member  States  /  Kingdom of Norway</p><p></p><p></p><p>10. Joint Declaration on management of fisheries resources in waters  north of 62° N</p><p></p><p>The Contracting Parties note the vulnerable and sensitive eco-system of the Barents  Sea and northern waters, and recognize the vital need to maintain sound management, based on  sustainable conservation and optimal utilisation of all stocks in these waters.</p><p> They agree that upon the integration of these waters into the common fisheries policy (CFP), such  integration shall be based on the existing management regime in order to continue and improve  current technical, control and enforcement standards.</p><p> They agree that established regional marine research and scientific institutions close to the  relevant waters should continue to make important contributions to the decision-making process in  order to provide for rapid and necessary management decisions within the framework of the CFP.</p><p> They agree that the negotiations with Russia conducted within the framework of the CFP should be  inspired by the principles and practices developed in the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries  Commission.</p><p> They agree that the present system, whereby consultation with interested fisheries organisations  are carried out before negotiations with Russia take place, should be maintained.</p><p> They further agree that management objectives and measures include:</p><p> -  that due account be taken of the interrelationship between stocks in a multi-species, management  perspective,</p><p> -  that the management of pelagic stocks should take into account that such species constitute an  important source of food for other species,</p><p> -  that optimal and stable outtake of the stocks should be ensured, in the long term,</p><p> -  that when fixing the TAC for a stock, due account should be taken of the conservation of the  spawning stock to ensure sufficient recruitment,</p><p> -  that catches of demersal stocks considered to be within safe biological limits, should be kept  within the reproductive ability of the stock and take due account of the special conditions  relevant for each individual stock,</p><p> -  that for demersal stocks outside safe biological limits, measures should be taken to rebuild the  stock to sustainable level, also taking into account the minimum requirements of the fishing  industry,</p><p> -  that considerable significance will continue to be attached to the advice of the Advisory  Committee on Fisheries Management (ACFM).</p><p> The Contracting Parties recognize that the special interests of Norway as the coastal state in  waters North of 62° N and of all parties concerned must be taken into account in the future  management of these waters according to the rules of the common fisheries policy.</p><p> In addition, and as a temporary derogation to the rules in order to encourage a gradual integration  of Norway to the CFP, the Contracting Parties have agreed that from the date of accession:</p><p> 1.  Norway is authorized to establish TAC levels and to maintain its fisheries agreement with  Russia for a transitional period until 1 July 1998 at the latest; during this transitional period,  the establishment of TAC levels and the management of this agreement is ensured by Norway in close  association with the Commission;</p><p> 2. Norway can maintain in these waters on a non-discriminatory basis its current system of:</p><p> -  technical regulations for a transitional period of 1 year,</p><p> - a discard ban for a transitional period of 3 years,</p><p> - control measures, and in particular the closing and opening of sensitive areas for a transitional  period of 3 years.</p><p> During these transitional periods, the Union will examine how best these regulatory mechanisms can  be integrated into the common fisheries policy.</p><p>  </p>
