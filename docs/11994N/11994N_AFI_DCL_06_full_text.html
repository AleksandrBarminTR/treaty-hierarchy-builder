<p>6. Joint Declaration on standards for the protection of the environment, health and product  safety</p><p></p><p>The Contracting Parties emphasize the great importance of promoting a high level of health,  safety and environmental protection as part of Community action, in conformity with the objectives  and in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty on European Union. In this context they  also refer to the Resolution of 1 February 1993 on a Community programme of policy and action in  relation to the environment and sustainable development.</p><p> Conscious of the attachment of the new Member States to the preservation of the standards they have  implemented in certain fields, owing in particular to their special geographical and climatic  conditions, the Contracting Parties have agreed, exceptionally and for specific cases, on a  procedure for examining the existing &#039;acquis communautaire`, with the full participation of the new  Member States, under the terms and conditions laid down in the Accession Treaty.</p><p> Without prejudice to the outcome of the agreed examination procedure, the Contracting Parties  undertake to make every endeavour to conclude that procedure before the expiry of the transitional  period laid down. At the end of the transitional period, the entire &#039;acquis communautaire` will be  applicable in the new Member States under the same conditions as in the present Member States of  the Union.</p><p>  </p>
