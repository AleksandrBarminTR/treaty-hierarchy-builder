<p>CHAPTER 1 Provisions concerning national aids </p><p></p><p>Article 138 </p><p>1.  During the transitional period,  subject to authorization by the Commission, Norway, Austria and Finland may grant, in an  appropriate form, transitional and degressive national aids to producers of basic agricultural  products subject to the common agricultural policy.</p><p> These aids may be the subject of differentiation in particular by region.</p><p> 2.  The Commission shall authorize the aids provided for in paragraph 1:</p><p> -  in all cases where the factors introduced by a new Member State show that significant  differences exist between the level of support granted by product to its producers before accession  and that which may be granted under the common agricultural policy;</p><p> -  up to an initial amount equal, at most, to this difference.</p><p> Initial differences of less than 10  % shall not be deemed significant.</p><p> However, the Commission&#039;s authorizations:</p><p> -  shall be granted in conformity with the international commitments of the enlarged Community;</p><p> -  shall, as far as pigmeat, eggs and poultry are concerned, take account of the price alignment of  feed;</p><p> -  shall not be granted for tobacco.</p><p> 3.  The amount of support provided for in paragraph 2 shall be calculated by basic agricultural  product. This calculation shall take into consideration in particular the support measures of  prices by intervention mechanisms or by other mechanisms as well as the grant of aids linked to  surface area, to prices, to the quantity produced or to the production unit, and the grant of aids  to holdings for specific products.</p><p> 4.  Authorizations by the Commission shall:</p><p> -  define the maximum initial level of the aids, the rate at which they decrease and, where  appropriate, the conditions for the granting thereof, taking account also of other aids resulting  from Community legislation which are not covered by this Article;</p><p> -  be granted subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary:</p><p> -  by developments in the common agricultural policy;</p><p> -  by developments in the level of prices in the Community.</p><p> Should such adjustments prove necessary, the amount of the aids or the conditions for the granting  thereof shall be amended at the Commission&#039;s request or on the basis of a decision by the  Commission.</p><p> 5.  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4, the Commission shall authorize, under  paragraph 1, in particular, the national aids provided for in Annex XIII, up to the limits and  under the conditions provided for in the said Annex.</p><p>  </p>
