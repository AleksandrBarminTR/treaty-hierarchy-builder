<p>12. Joint Declaration on ownership of fishing vessels</p><p></p><p>The Contracting Parties take note of the  rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and recognize that, in the context of  the common fisheries policy, one of the aims of the system of national quotas, which are allocated  to Member States according to the principle of relative stability, is to safeguard the particular  needs of regions where local populations are especially dependent on fisheries and related  industries.</p><p> That aim may justify conditions designed to ensure that there is a real economic link between  vessels fishing against the quotas of a Member State and that Member State, if the purpose of such  conditions is that the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries should benefit  from the quotas.</p><p>  </p>
