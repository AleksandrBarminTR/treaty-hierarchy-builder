<p>CHAPTER 3 Competition policy </p><p></p><p>Article 71 </p><p>1.  Without prejudice to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this  Article, the Republic of Austria shall progressively adjust as from the date of accession its  monopoly of manufactured tobacco of a commercial character within the meaning of Article 37 (1) of  the EC Treaty so as to ensure that, at the latest three years from the date of accession, no  discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between  nationals of Member States.</p><p> 2.  As regards the products set out in the list in Annex IX, the exclusive import right shall be  abolished at latest on expiry of a period of three years from the date of accession. Abolition of  that exclusive right shall be carried out by the progressive opening, as from the date of  accession, of quotas for the import of products from Member States. At the beginning of each of the  three years under consideration, the Republic of Austria shall open a quota calculated on the basis  of the following percentages of national consumption: 15  % for the first year, 40  % for the  second year, 70  % for the third year. The volumes corresponding to the percentages for the three  years are given in the list in Annex IX.</p><p> The quotas referred to in the preceding subparagraph shall be open to all operators, without  restriction, and products imported under those quotas may not, in the Republic of Austria, be  subject to an exclusive marketing right at wholesale trade level; as regards retail sale of  products imported under quotas, disposal of such products to consumers must be carried out in a  non-discriminatory manner.</p><p> 3.  At the latest one year after its accession, the Republic of Austria shall set up an independent  authority with responsibility for granting authorizations for conducting retail trade, in  accordance with the EC Treaty.</p><p>  </p>
