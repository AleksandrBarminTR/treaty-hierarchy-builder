Priority should be given to those measures set out in the  Community&#039;s provisions on railways and combined transport. In implementing any measures, particular  attention shall be attached to the competitiveness, effectiveness and cost transparency of rail and  combined transport. In particular, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to take such  measures so as to ensure that prices for combined transport are competitive with those for other  modes of transport. Any aid granted to these ends shall comply with Community rules.</p><p> </p><p>Article 8 </p><p>The Community and the Member States concerned shall, in the event of a serious  disturbance in rail transit, such as a natural disaster, take all possible concerted action to  maintain the flow of traffic. Priority shall be given to sensitive loads, such as perishable  foods.</p><p> </p><p>Article 9 </p><p>The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16, shall  review the operation of this Part.</p><p> </p><p>PART III ROAD TRANSPORT </p><p></p><p>Article 10 </p><p>This Part shall apply to the carriage of goods by road on  journeys carried out within the territory of the Community.</p><p> </p><p>Article 11 </p><p>1.  For journeys which involve transit of goods by road through Austria, the regime  established for journeys on own account and for journeys for hire or reward under the First Council  Directive of 23 July 1962 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 shall apply subject to the  provisions of this Article.</p><p> 2.  Until 1 January 1998, the following provisions shall apply:</p><p> (a)  The total of NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles crossing Austria in transit shall be  reduced by 60  % in the period between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2003, according to the table  in Annex 4.</p><p> (b) The reductions in total NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles shall be administered according  to an ecopoints system. Under that system any heavy goods vehicle crossing Austria in transit shall  require a number of ecopoints equivalent to its NOx emissions (authorized under the Conformity of  Production (COP) value or type-approval value). The method of calculation and administration of  such points is described in Annex 5.</p><p> (c) If the number of transit journeys in any year exceeds the reference figure established for 1991  by more than 8  %, the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16,  shall adopt appropriate measures in accordance with paragraph 3 of Annex 5.</p><p> (d) Austria shall issue and make available in good time the ecopoints cards required for the  administration of the ecopoints system, pursuant to Annex 5, for heavy goods vehicles crossing  Austria in transit.</p><p> (e) The ecopoints shall be distributed by the Commission among Member States in accordance with  provisions to be established in accordance with paragraph 6.</p><p> 3.  Before 1 January 1998, the Council, on the basis of a report by the Commission, shall review  the operation of provisions concerning transit of goods by road through Austria. The review shall  take place in conformity with basic principles of Community law, such as the proper functioning of  the internal market, in particular the free movement of goods and freedom to provide services,  protection of the environment in the interest of the Community as a whole, and traffic safety.  Unless the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the  European Parliament, decides otherwise, the transitional period shall be extended to 1 January  2001, during which the provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply.</p><p> 4.  Before 1 January 2001, the Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency,  shall make a scientific study of the degree to which the objective concerning reduction of  pollution set out in paragraph 2 (a) has been achieved. If the Commission concludes that this  objective has been achieved on a sustainable basis, the provisions of paragraph 2 shall cease to  apply on 1 January 2001. If the Commission concludes that this objective has not been achieved on a  sustainable basis the Council, acting in accordance with Article 75 of the EC Treaty, may adopt  measures, within a Community framework, which ensure equivalent protection of the environment, in  particular a 60  % reduction of pollution. If the Council does not adopt such measures, the  transitional period shall be automatically extended for a final period of three years, during which  the provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply.</p><p> 5.  At the end of the transitional period, the &#039;acquis communautaire` in its entirety shall be  applied.</p><p> 6.  The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16, shall adopt  detailed measures concerning the procedures relating to the ecopoints system, the distribution of  ecopoints and technical questions concerning the application of this Article, which shall enter  into force on the date of accession of Austria.</p><p> The measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall ensure that the factual situation for the  present Member States resulting from the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3637/92 and of  the Administrative Arrangement, signed on 23 December 1992, setting the date of entry into force  and the procedures for the introduction of the ecopoints system referred to in the Transit  Agreement, is maintained. All necessary efforts shall be made to ensure that the share of ecopoints  allocated to Greece takes sufficient account of Greek needs in this context.</p><p> </p><p>Article 12 </p><p>1.  For international carriage of goods on journeys between Member States, the regime  established under Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 shall apply subject to the provisions set out  in this Article. These provisions shall be applicable until 31 December 1996.</p><p> 2.  For bilateral journeys, existing quotas shall be progressively liberalized and full freedom to  provide transport services shall be effective as from 1 January 1997. A first stage of  liberalization shall take effect on the date of accession of Austria, a second stage on 1 January  1996.</p><p> If necessary, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may  take appropriate measures to that effect.</p><p> 3.  The Council, acting in accordance with Article 75 of the Treaty, shall adopt appropriate and  simple measures to prevent circumvention of the provisions of Article 11 by 1 January 1997 at the  latest.</p><p> 4.  As long as the provisions of Article 11 (2) apply, the Member States, in the framework of their  mutual cooperation, shall, if necessary, take measures compatible with the EC Treaty against misuse  of the ecopoints system.</p><p> 5.  Hauliers with a Community authorization issued by the competent authorities in Austria shall  not be entitled to carry out an international carriage of goods on journeys where neither loading  nor unloading takes place in Austria. All such journeys involving transit through Austria shall,  however, be subject to the provisions of Article 11 and also, with the exception of journeys  between Germany and Italy, to existing quotas, which shall be subject to the provisions of  paragraph 2 above.</p><p> </p><p>Article 13 </p><p>1.  Until 31 December 1996, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 shall not  apply to hauliers with a Community authorization issued by the competent authorities in Austria for  the operation of national road haulage services in other Member States.</p><p> 2.  During the same period, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 shall not apply to  hauliers with a Community authorization issued by the competent authorities in another Member State  for the operation of national road haulage services in Austria.</p><p> </p><p>Article 14 </p><p>1.

The following documents shall be submitted for each heavy goods vehicle each time  it travels through Austria (in either direction):</p><p> (a)  a document showing the COP value for NOx emissions from the vehicle in question;</p><p> (b) a valid ecopoints card issued by the competent authority.</p><p> Concerning (a):</p><p> in the case of heavy goods vehicles registered after 1 October 1990, the document showing the COP  value shall be a certificate issued by the appropriate authority giving details of an official COP  value for NOx emissions or the type-approval certificate showing the date of registration and value  established for type-approval purposes. In the latter case, the COP value shall be the  type-approval increased by 10  %. Once such a value has been determined for a vehicle it cannot be  changed during the vehicle&#039;s life.</p><p> In the case of vehicles registered before 1 October 1990 and vehicles for which no certificate has  been submitted, a COP value of 15,8 g/kWh shall be set.</p><p> Concerning (b):</p><p> the ecopoints card shall contain a certain number of points and shall be endorsed as follows on the  basis of the COP value for the vehicles in question:</p><p> 1.  each g/kWh NOx emission corresponding to the value shown in the document referred to in 1 (a)  shall count as one point:</p><p> 2. NOx emission values shall be rounded up to the next full point when they are to a decimal place  of 0,5 or more, otherwise they shall be rounded down.</p><p> 2. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 16, shall at  threemonth intervals calculate the number of journeys and the average NOx value of the heavy goods  vehicles detailed for each nationality.</p><p> 3. If Article 11 (2) (c) applies, the number of ecopoints for the following year shall be  established as follows:</p><p> The quarterly average NOx emission values for lorries in the current year, calculated in accordance  with paragraph 2 above, will be extrapolated to produce the average NOx emission value anticipated  for the following year. The forecast value, multiplied by 0,0658 and by the number of ecopoints for  1991 set out in Annex 4, will be the number of ecopoints for the year in question.</p><p>  </p>
