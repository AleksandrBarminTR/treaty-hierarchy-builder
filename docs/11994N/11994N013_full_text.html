<p>Article 13 </p><p>The following is substituted for Article 28 of the ECSC Treaty:</p><p> &#039;Article 28</p><p>When the Council is consulted by the Commission, it shall consider the matter without  necessarily taking a vote. The minutes of its proceedings shall be forwarded to the Commission.</p><p> Wherever this Treaty requires that the assent of the Council be given, that assent shall be  considered to have been given if the proposal submitted by the Commission receives the approval:</p><p> -  of an absolute majority of the representatives of the Member States, including the votes of the  representatives of two Member States which each produce at least one tenth of the total value of  the coal and steel output of the Community, or</p><p>-  in the event of an equal division of votes and if  the Commission maintains its proposal after a second discussion, of the representatives of three  Member States which each produce at least one tenth of the total value of the coal and steel output  of the Community.</p><p> Wherever this Treaty requires a unanimous decision or unanimous assent, such decision or assent  shall have been duly given if all the members of the Council vote in favour. However, for the  purposes of applying Articles 21, 32, 32a, 45b and 78h of this Treaty, and Article 16, the third  paragraph of Article 20, the fifth paragraph of Article 28 and Article 44 of the Protocol on the  Statute of the Court of Justice, abstention by members present in person or represented shall not  prevent the adoption by the Council of acts which require unanimity.</p><p> Decisions of the Council, other than those for which a qualified majority or unanimity is required,  shall be taken by a vote of the majority of its members; this majority shall be considered to be  attained if it represents an absolute majority of the representatives of the Member States,  including the votes of the representatives of two Member States which each produce at least one  tenth of the total value of the coal and steel output of the Community. However, for the purpose of  applying Articles 45b, 78 and 78b of this Treaty which require a qualified majority, the votes of  the members of the Council are weighted as follows:</p><p> &gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p></p><p>For their adoption, acts shall require at least 64 votes in favour, cast by not  less than 11 members.</p><p> Where a vote is taken, any member of the Council may act on behalf of not more than one other  member.</p><p> The Council shall deal with the Member States through its President.</p><p> The acts of the Council shall be published in such a manner as it may decide.`</p><p>  </p>
