The mixture is stored for an intermediary period pending new treatment.  The product is then introduced into a heat converter. The progression of the product through the  heat converter is controlled by means of mechanical commands limiting its displacement in such a  way that at the end of the heat treatment operation the product has undergone a cycle which is  sufficient in both time and temperature. After heat treatment, the product is separated into  liquid/fat/greaves phases by mechanical means. In order to obtain an animal protein concentrate,  the liquid phase is pumped into two heat-exchangers which are steam-heated and equipped with vacuum  chambers in order for its humidity to be removed therein in the form of water vapour. The greaves  are reincorporated in the protein concentrate before storage.</p><p> II.  Critical control points in factories</p><p>1.
