The Swedish authorities shall require the life-assurance  companies concerned to initiate immediately the process of reduction of the relevant exposures. The  companies concerned will at no time increase these exposures, unless they are already within the  limits prescribed by the Directive and any such increase does not lead them to exceed those limits.
