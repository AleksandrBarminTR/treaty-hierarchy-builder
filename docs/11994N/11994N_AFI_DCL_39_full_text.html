Declaration by the Kingdom of Norway on Sami matters</p><p></p><p>Having regard to Article 110A of the  Norwegian Constitution and the Norwegian Act of 12 June 1987 No 56,</p><p> Having regard to obligations and commitments set out in the United Nations International Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, and in particular Article 27 thereof, and ILO Convention No  169 on Indigenous and Tribal People in Independent Countries of 1989,</p><p> Norway has undertaken the responsibility to create conditions enabling the Sami people to preserve  and develop their means of livelihood, language, culture and way of life.</p><p> The Sami communities in traditional areas of Sami settlement are dependent on a number of  traditional economic activities. These activities are in themselves an integral part of Sami  culture, and form the necessary basis for the further development of the Sami way of life.</p><p> Taking into account the protocol on the Sami People, the Government of Norway declares that it will  continue on this basis to fulfil its obligations and commitments to the Sami People.</p><p>  </p>
