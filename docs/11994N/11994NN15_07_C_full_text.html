<p>C. ARABLE CROPS</p><p>392  R  1765: Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a  support system for producers of certain arable crops (OJ No L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 12), as last  amended by:</p><p> -  394  R  0231: Council Regulation (EC) No 231/94 of 24 January 1994 (OJ No L 30, 3.2.1994, p.  7).</p><p> 1.  By way of derogation from Article 7 (6), producers in Sweden who, pursuant to a national  set-aside scheme, have set aside a greater area of land than that on which they intend to grow  eligible arable crops, and who have not recommenced the growing of crops on that land, may, on the  cessation of their participation in the national scheme, continue to set aside land which they had  already set aside under such scheme for a further period of 60 months. Payment of the set-aside  shall then be established at the rate referred to in Article 7 (6) for the portion exceeding that  under arable crops for which compensatory payment is requested.</p><p> 2.  Until the marketing year 1999/2000 Austria may, subject to prior authorization by the  Commission make a payment, equal to that payable before accession, to small producers, as defined  in Article 8 (2), who continue to set-aside an area of land equal to that for which they received  payment under a national scheme at 1 January 1994. The cost of such payment shall be borne by  Austria.</p><p>  </p>
