<p>43. Declaration by the Republic of Austria on pricing of combined transport on the Brenner  route</p><p></p><p>The Republic of Austria declares its willingness to promote, in conformity with Community  rules, the use of piggy-back combined transport on the Brenner route by seeking on the Austrian  section an appropriate price for such transport which is competitive with prices for transport by  road. The Republic of Austria notes that this measure will be taken on the understanding that the  market impact of aids granted by the Republic of Austria is not reduced by measures taken on other  sections of the abovementioned piggy-back link.</p><p>  </p>
