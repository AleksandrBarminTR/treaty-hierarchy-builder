<p>Article 152 </p><p>1.  If, before 1 January 1996, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to  persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the  economic situation of a given area, a new Member State may apply for authorization to take  protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector concerned to the  economy of the common market.</p><p> In the same circumstances, any present Member State may apply for authorization to take protective  measures with regard to one or more of the new Member States.</p><p> 2.  Upon request by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, determine  the protective measures which it considers necessary, specifying the conditions and modalities in  which they are to be put into effect.</p><p> In the event of serious economic difficulties and at the express request of the Member State  concerned, the Commission shall act within five working days of the receipt of the request  accompanied by the relevant background information. The measures thus decided on shall be  applicable forthwith, shall take account of the interest of all parties concerned and shall not  entail frontier controls.</p><p> 3.  The measures authorized under paragraph 2 may involve derogations from the rules of the EC  Treaty, the ECSC Treaty and this Act to such an extent and for such periods as are strictly  necessary in order to attain the objectives referred to in paragraph 1. Priority shall be given to  such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the common market.</p><p>  </p>
