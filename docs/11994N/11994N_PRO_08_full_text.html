                                                                            <p>If, in order to vote or to stand as candidates, nationals of the applicant State of  residence must have spent a certain minimum period as a resident in the electoral territory of that  State, a Community voter or a Community national entitled to stand as a candidate shall be deemed  to have fulfilled that condition where he has resided for an equivalent period in another Member  State. This provision shall not prejudice any specific conditions as to length of residence in a  given constituency or locality.</p>
                                                                            <p></p>

The applicant State of residence may check whether the citizens of the Union who  have expressed a desire to exercise their right to vote there have not been deprived of that right  in the home Member State through an individual criminal law or civil law decision.</p>

For the purposes of paragraph 1, the applicant State of residence may notify the home Member  State of the declaration referred to in Article 8 (2). To that end, the relevant and normally  available information from the home Member State shall be provided in good time and in an  appropriate manner; such information may only include details which are strictly necessary for the  implementation of this Article and may be used only for that purpose. If the information provided  invalidates the content of the declaration, the Member State of residence shall take the  appropriate steps to prevent the person concerned from voting.</p>
                                                                            <p> 3.  The home Member State may, in good time and in an appropriate manner, submit to the applicant  State of residence any information necessary for the implementation of this Article.</p>

                                                                            <p></p>

                                                                            <p>1.   The applicant State shall take the necessary measures to enable a Community voter who has expressed  the wish to be entered on the electoral roll sufficiently in advance of polling day.</p>
                                                                            <p> 2.  In order to have his name entered on the electoral roll, a Community voter shall produce the  same documents as a voter who is a national. He shall also produce a formal declaration stating:</p>
                                                                            <p> (a)  his nationality and his address in the electoral territory of the applicant State of  residence;</p>
                                                                            <p> (b) where applicable, the locality or constituency of any other Member State on the electoral roll  of which his name was last entered, and</p>
                                                                            <p>(c) that he has not exercised his right to vote in any of  the Member States in the 1994 elections.</p>

                                                                            <p> (a)  state in his declaration under paragraph 2 that he has not been deprived of the right to vote  in his home Member State:</p>
                                                                            <p> (b) produce a valid identity document, and</p>

                                                                            <p> 4.  Community voters who have been entered on the electoral roll shall remain thereon, under the  same conditions as voters who are nationals, until such time as they request to be removed or until  such time as they are removed automatically because they no longer satisfy the requirements for  exercising the right to vote.</p>
                                                                            <p></p>

                                                                            <p>1.  When he submits his application to stand as a candidate, a Community national shall  produce the same supporting documents as a candidate who is a national. He shall also produce a  formal declaration stating:</p>
                                                                            <p> (a)  his nationality and his address in the electoral territory of the applicant State of  residence;</p>

                                                                            <p>(c) where applicable, the locality or constituency of any other Member  State on the electoral roll of which his name was last entered.</p>

When he submits his application to stand as a candidate a Community national must also produce  an attestation from the competent administrative authorities of his home Member State certifying  that he has not been deprived of the right to stand as a candidate in that Member State or that no  such disqualification is known to those authorities.</p>
                                                                            <p> 3.  The applicant State of residence may also require a Community national entitled to stand as a  candidate to produce a valid identity document. It may also require him to indicate the date from  which he has been a national of a Member State.</p>
                                                                            <p></p>
                                                                            <p>Article 10 </p>
                                                                            <p>1.

                                                                            <p> 2.  Should a person be refused entry on the electoral roll or his application to stand as a  candidate be rejected, the person concerned shall be entitled to legal remedies on the same terms  as the legislation of the applicant State of residence prescribes for voters and persons entitled  to stand as candidates who are its nationals.</p>
                                                                            <p></p>

                                                                            <p> However, Community voters and Community nationals entitled to stand as candidates who, owing to the  fact that they have taken up residence outside their home Member State or by reason of the duration  of such residence, do not have the right to vote or to stand as candidates in that home State shall  not be subject to the conditions as to length of residence set out above.</p>
