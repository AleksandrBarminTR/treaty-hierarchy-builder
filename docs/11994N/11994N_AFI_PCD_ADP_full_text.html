In order to ensure that the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland  and the Kingdom of Sweden, hereinafter referred to as the &#039;acceding States`, are kept adequately  informed, any proposal or communication from the Commission of the European Communities which might  lead to decisions by the Council of the European Union shall be brought to the knowledge of the  acceding States after being transmitted to the Council.</p><p> 2.  Consultations shall take place pursuant to a reasoned request by an acceding State, which shall  set out expressly therein its interests as a future member of the Union and its observations.</p><p> 3.  Administrative decisions shall not, as a general rule, give rise to consultations.</p><p> 4.  Consultations shall take place within an Interim Committee composed of representatives of the  Union and of the acceding States.</p><p> 5.  On the Union side, the members of the Interim Committee shall be the members of the Permanent  Representatives Committee or persons designated by them for this purpose. The Commission shall be  invited to be represented in this work.</p><p> 6.  The Interim Committee shall be assisted by a Secretariat, which shall be that of the  Conference, continued for this purpose.</p><p> 7.  Consultations shall normally take place as soon as the preparatory work carried out at Union  level with a view to the adoption of decisions by the Council has produced common guidelines  enabling such consultations to be usefully arranged.</p><p> 8.  If serious difficulties remain after consultations, the matter may be raised at ministerial  level at the request of an acceding State.</p><p> 9.  The above provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to the decisions of the Board of Governors of  the European Investment Bank.</p><p> 10.  The procedure laid down in the above paragraphs shall also apply to any decision to be taken  by the acceding States which might affect the commitments resulting from their position as future  members of the Union.</p><p> II.</p><p> 1.  The procedure provided for under I shall apply mutatis mutandis to draft Council Decisions  defining common positions within the meaning of Article J.2 of the TEU or adopting joint actions  within the meaning of Article J.3, subject to the following provisions.</p><p> 2.  It is for the Presidency to bring these drafts to the attention of the acceding States when the  proposal or communication is issued by a Member State.</p><p> 3.  Save for a reasoned objection from an acceding State, consultations may take place in the form  of the exchange of telefaxed messages.</p><p> 4.  Should consultations take place within the Interim Committee, the Members of that Committee  belonging to the Union may, where appropriate, be the Members of the Political Committee.</p><p> III.</p><p> 1.  The procedure provided for under I shall apply mutatis mutandis to draft Council Decisions  defining joint positions or adopting joint actions within the meaning of Article K.3 of the TEU and  also to the drawing up of conventions as provided for under that Article, subject to the following  provisions.</p><p> 2.  It is for the Presidency to bring these drafts to the attention of the acceding States when the  proposal or communication is issued by a Member State.</p><p> 3.

These adaptations or adjustments will be negotiated by the Community in  association with the representatives of the acceding States in accordance with the procedure  referred to in the preceding paragraph.</p><p> VI.</p><p> The institutions shall, in due course, draw up the texts referred to in Article 170 of the Act  concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties.</p><p>  </p>
