The following goods originating in Svalbard may be imported into the Union free  from customs duties, charges having equivalent effect and quantitative restrictions:</p><p> &gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p></p><p>2.

(a)  The products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be considered as originating in Svalbard,  for the purpose of this Protocol, where they are wholly obtained there, which means that they have  been extracted from the ground in Svalbard.</p><p> (b) These products shall, upon importation into the Union, benefit from the provisions of this  Protocol upon submission of a declaration given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or  any other commercial document.</p><p> (c) The Norwegian customs authorities shall take appropriate measures to ensure the proper  application of the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p> 4.

Where any difficulties arise in the implementation of the provisions of this Article, the  Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt appropriate  measures.</p><p> </p><p>Article 3 </p><p>The application of the provisions of this Protocol shall not in any way prejudice the  positions of the Contracting Parties in respect of the application of the Treaty of Paris of 1920.</p><p>  </p>
