<p> DECLARATION on Western European Union  </p><p>The Conference notes the following declarations: </p><p> I. Declaration by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which are members of the Western European Union and also members of the European Union on the role of the Western European Union and its relations with the European Union and with the Atlantic Alliance</p><p> Introduction</p><p> 1. WEU Member States agree on the need to develop a genuine European security and defence identity and a greater European responsibility on defence matters. This identity will be pursued through a gradual process involving successive phases. WEU will form an integral part of the process of the development of the European Union and will enhance its contribution to solidarity within the Atlantic Alliance. WEU Member States agree to strengthen the role of WEU, in the longer term perspective of a common defence policy within the European Union which might in time lead to a common defence, compatible with that of the Atlantic Alliance. </p><p> 2. WEU will be developed as the defence component of the European Union and as a means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance. To this end, it will formulate common European defence policy and carry forward its concrete implementation through the further development of its own operational role. </p><p> WEU Member States take note of Article J.4 relating to the common foreign and security policy of the Treaty on European Union which reads as follows: </p><p>    &#039;1. The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence. </p><p> 2. The Union requests the Western European Union (WEU), which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. The Council shall, in agreement with the institutions of the WEU, adopt the necessary practical arrangements. </p><p> 3. Issues having defence implications dealt with under this Article shall not be subject to the procedures set out in Article J.3. </p><p> 4. The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework. </p><p> 5. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the WEU and the Atlantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this Title. </p><p> 6. With a view to furthering the objective of this Treaty, and having in view the date of 1998 in the context of Article XII of the Brussels Treaty, the provisions of this Article may be revised as provided for in Article N(2) on the basis of a report to be presented in 1996 by the Council to the European  Council, which shall include an evaluation of the progress made and the experience gained until then.&#039;</p><p> A. WEU&#039;s relations with European Union</p><p> 3. The objective is to build up WEU in stages as the defence component of the European Union. To this end, WEU is prepared, at the request of the European Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. </p><p> To this end, WEU will take the following measures to develop a close working relationship with the Union: </p><p> -  as appropriate, synchronization of the dates and venues of meetings and harmonization of working methods; </p><p> -  establishment of close cooperation between the Council and Secretariat-General of WEU on the one hand, and the Council of the Union and General Secretariat of the Council on the other; </p><p> -  consideration of the harmonization of the sequence and duration of the respective Presidencies; </p><p> -  arranging for appropriate modalities so as to ensure that the Commission of the European Communities is regularly informed and, as appropriate, consulted on WEU activities in accordance with the role of the Commission in the common foreign and security policy as defined in the Treaty on European Union; </p><p> -  encouragement of closer cooperation between the Parliamentary Assembly of WEU and the European Parliament. </p><p> The WEU Council shall, in agreement with the competent bodies of the European Union, adopt the necessary practical arrangements. </p><p> B. WEU&#039;s relations with the Atlantic Alliance</p><p> 4. The objective is to develop WEU as a means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance. Accordingly WEU is prepared to develop further the close working links between WEU and the Alliance and to strengthen the role, responsibilities and contributions of WEU Member States in the Alliance. This will be undertaken on the basis of the necessary transparency and complementarity between the emerging European security and defence identity and the Alliance. WEU will act in conformity with the positions adopted in the Atlantic Alliance. </p><p> -  WEU Member States will intensify their coordination on Alliance issues which represent an important common interest with the aim of introducing joint positions agreed in WEU into the process of consultation in the Alliance which will remain the essential forum for consultation among its members and the venue for agreement on policies bearing on the security and defence commitments of Allies under the North Atlantic Treaty. </p><p> -  Where necessary, dates and venues of meetings will be synchronized and working methods harmonized. </p><p> -  Close cooperation will be established between the Secretariats-General of WEU and NATO. </p><p> C. Operational role of WEU</p><p> 5. WEU&#039;s operational role will be strengthened by examining and defining appropriate missions, structures and means, covering in particular: </p><p> -  WEU planning cell; </p><p> -  closer military cooperation complementary to the Alliance in particular in the fields of logistics, transport, training and strategic surveillance; </p><p> -  meetings of WEU Chiefs of Defence Staff; </p><p> -  military units answerable to WEU. </p><p> Other proposals will be examined further, including: </p><p>  -  enhanced cooperation in the field of armaments with the aim of creating a European armaments agency; </p><p> -  development of the WEU Institute into a European Security and Defence Academy. </p><p> Arrangements aimed at giving WEU a stronger operational role will be fully compatible with the military dispositions necessary to ensure the collective defence of all Allies. </p><p> D. Other measures</p><p> 6. As a consequence of the measures set out above, and in order to facilitate the strengthening of WEU&#039;s role, the seat of the WEU Council and Secretariat will be transferred to Brussels. </p><p> 7. Representation on the WEU Council must be such that the Council is able to exercise its functions continuously in accordance with Article VIII of the modified Brussels Treaty. Member States may draw on a double-hatting formula, to be worked out, consisting of their representatives to the Alliance and to the European Union. </p><p> 8. WEU notes that, in accordance with the provisions of Article J.4(6) concerning the common foreign and security policy of the Treaty on European Union, the Union will decide to review the provisions of this Article with a view to furthering the objective to be set by it in accordance with the procedure defined. The WEU will re-examine the present provisions in 1996. This re-examination will take account of the progress and experience acquired and will extend to relations between WEU and the Atlantic Alliance. </p><p> II. Declaration by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which are members of the Western European Union</p><p> &#039;The Member States of WEU welcome the development of the European security and defence identity. They are determined, taking into account the role of WEU as the defence component of the European Union and as the means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance, to put the relationship between WEU and the other European States on a new basis for the sake of stability and security in Europe. In this spirit, they propose the following: </p><p> States which are members of the European Union are invited to accede to WEU on conditions to be agreed in accordance with Article XI of the modified Brussels Treaty, or to become observers if they so wish. Simultaneously, other European Member States of NATO are invited to become associate members of WEU in a way which will give them the possibility of participating fully in the activities of WEU. </p><p> The Member States of WEU assume that treaties and agreements corresponding with the above proposals will be concluded before 31 December 1992.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
