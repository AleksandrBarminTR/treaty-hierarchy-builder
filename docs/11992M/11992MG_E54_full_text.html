<p> 54) Article 175 shall be replaced by the following: </p><p> &#039;Article 175</p><p> Should the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission, in infringement of this Treaty, fail to act, the Member States and the other institutions of the Community may bring an action before the Court of Justice to have the infringement established. </p><p>  The action shall be admissible only if the institution concerned has first been called upon to act. If, within two months of being so called upon, the institution concerned has not defined its position, the action may be brought within a further period of two months. </p><p>  Any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the preceding paragraphs, complain to the Court of Justice that an institution  of the Community has failed to address to that person any act other than a recommendation or an opinion. </p><p>  The Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction, under the same conditions, in actions or proceedings brought by the ECB in the areas falling within the latter&#039;s field of competence and in actions or proceedings brought against the latter.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
