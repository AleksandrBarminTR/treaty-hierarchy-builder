<p> Article 2 </p><p> 1. With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 1, the Community shall support and complement the activities of the Member States in the following fields: </p><p> - improvement in particular of the working environment to protect workers&#039; health and safety; </p><p> - working conditions; </p><p> - the information and consultation of workers; </p><p> - equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work; </p><p> - the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article 127 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter referred to as &#039;the Treaty&#039;). </p><p> 2. To this end, the Council may adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for gradual implementation, having regard to the conditions and technical rules obtaining in each of the Member States. Such directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings. </p><p> The Council shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty after consulting the Economic and Social Committee. </p><p> 3. However, the Council shall act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, in the following areas: </p><p> - social security and social protection of workers; </p><p> - protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated; </p><p> - representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers, including co-determination, subject to paragraph 6; </p><p> - conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Community territory; </p><p> - financial contributions for promotion of employment and job-creation, without prejudice to the provisions relating to the Social Fund. </p><p> 4. A Member State may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the implementation of directives adopted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3. </p><p>  In this case, it shall ensure that, no later than the date on which a directive must be transposed in accordance with Article 189, management and labour have introduced the necessary measures by agreement, the Member State concerned being required to take any necessary measure enabling it at any time to be in a position to guarantee the results imposed by that directive. </p><p> 5. The provisions adopted pursuant to this Article shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures compatible with the Treaty. </p><p> 6. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs. </p><p>  </p>
