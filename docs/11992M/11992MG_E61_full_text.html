<p> 61) The following Articles shall be inserted: </p><p> &#039;Article 189a</p><p> 1. Where, in pursuance of this Treaty, the Council acts on a proposal from the Commission, unanimity shall be required for an act constituting an amendment to that proposal, subject to Article 189b(4) and (5). </p><p> 2. As long as the Council has not acted, the Commission may alter its proposal at any time during the procedures leading to the adoption of a Community act. </p><p> Article 189b</p><p> 1. Where reference is made in this Treaty to this Article for the adoption of an act, the following procedure shall apply. </p><p> 2. The Commission shall submit a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council. </p><p> The Council, acting by a qualified majority after obtaining the opinion of the European Parliament, shall adopt a common position. The common position shall be communicated to the European Parliament. The Council shall inform the European Parliament fully of the reasons which led it to adopt its common position. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament fully of its position. </p><p> If, within three months of such communication, the European Parliament: </p><p> (a) approves the common position, the Council shall definitively adopt the act in question in accordance with that common position; </p><p> (b) has not taken a decision, the Council shall adopt the act in question in accordance with its common position; </p><p> (c) indicates, by an absolute majority of its component members, that it intends to reject the common position, it shall immediately inform the Council. The Council may convene a meeting of the Conciliation Committee referred to  in paragraph 4 to explain further its position. The European Parliament shall thereafter either confirm, by an absolute majority of its component members, its rejection of the common position, in which event the proposed act shall be deemed not to have been adopted, or propose amendments in accordance with subparagraph (d) of this paragraph; </p><p> (d) proposes amendments to the common position by an absolute majority of its component members, the amended text shall be forwarded to the Council and to the Commission, which shall deliver an opinion on those amendments. </p><p> 3. If, within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Council, acting by a qualified majority, approves all the amendments of the European Parliament, it shall amend its common position accordingly and adopt the act in question; however, the Council shall act unanimously on the amendments on which the Commission has delivered a negative opinion. If the Council does not approve the act in question, the President of the Council, in agreement with the President of the European Parliament, shall forthwith convene a meeting of the Conciliation Committee. </p><p> 4. The Conciliation Committee, which shall be composed of the members of the Council or their representatives and an equal number of representatives of the European Parliament, shall have the task of reaching agreement on a joint text, by a qualified majority of the members of the Council or their representatives and by a majority of the representatives of the European Parliament. The Commission shall take part in the Conciliation Committee&#039;s proceedings and shall take all the necessary initiatives with a view to reconciling the positions of the European Parliament and the Council. </p><p> 5. If, within six weeks of its being convened, the Conciliation Committee approves a joint text, the European Parliament, acting by an absolute majority of the votes cast, and the Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall have a period of six weeks from that approval in which to adopt the act in question in accordance with the joint text. If one of the two institutions fails to approve the proposed act, it shall be deemed not to have been adopted. </p><p> 6. Where the Conciliation Committee does not approve a joint text, the proposed act shall be deemed not to have been adopted unless the Council, acting by a qualified majority within six weeks of expiry of the period granted to the Conciliation Committee, confirms the common position to which it agreed before the conciliation procedure was initiated, possibly with amendments proposed by the European Parliament. In this case, the act in question shall be finally adopted unless the European Parliament, within six weeks of the date of confirmation by the Council, rejects the text by an absolute majority of its component members, in which case the proposed act shall be deemed not to have been adopted. </p><p> 7. The periods of three months and six weeks referred to in this Article may be extended by a maximum of one month and two weeks respectively by common accord of the European Parliament and the Council. The period of three months referred to in paragraph 2 shall be automatically extended by two months where paragraph 2(c) applies. </p><p> 8. The scope of the procedure under this Article may be  widened, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article N(2) of the Treaty on European Union, on the basis of a report to be submitted to the Council by the Commission by 1996 at the latest. </p><p> Article 189c</p><p> Where reference is made in this Treaty to this Article for the adoption of an act, the following procedure shall apply: </p><p> (a) The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the opinion of the European Parliament, shall adopt a common position. </p><p> (b) The Council&#039;s common position shall be communicated to the European Parliament. The Council and the Commission shall inform the European Parliament fully of the reasons which led the Council to adopt its common position and also of the Commission&#039;s position. </p><p> If, within three months of such communication, the European Parliament approves this common position or has not taken a decision within that period, the Council shall definitively adopt the act in question in accordance with the common position. </p><p> (c) The European Parliament may, within the period of three months referred to in point (b), by an absolute majority of its component members, propose amendments to the Council&#039;s common position. The European Parliament may also, by the same majority, reject the Council&#039;s common position. The result of the proceedings shall be transmitted to the Council and the Commission. </p><p> If the European Parliament has rejected the Council&#039;s common position, unanimity shall be required for the Council to act on a second reading. </p><p> (d) The Commission shall, within a period of one month, re- examine the proposal on the basis of which the Council adopted its common position, by taking into account the amendments proposed by the European Parliament. </p><p> The Commission shall forward to the Council, at the same time as its re-examined proposal, the amendments of the European Parliament which it has not accepted, and shall express its opinion on them. The Council may adopt these amendments unanimously. </p><p> (e) The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall adopt the proposal as re-examined by the Commission. </p><p> Unanimity shall be required for the Council to amend the proposal as re-examined by the Commission. </p><p> (f) In the cases referred to in points (c), (d) and (e), the Council shall be required to act within a period of three months. If no decision is taken within this period, the Commission proposal shall be deemed not to have been adopted. </p><p> (g) The periods referred to in points (b) and (f) may be extended by a maximum of one month by common accord between the Council and the European Parliament.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
