For the purpose of implementing Article 74, and taking  into account the distinctive features of transport, the Council shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, lay down: </p><p> (a)  common rules applicable to international transport to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States; </p><p>  (b) the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate transport services within a Member State; </p><p>  (c) measures to improve transport safety; </p><p>  (d) any other appropriate provisions. </p><p>  2. The provisions referred to in (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down during the transitional period. </p><p> 3. By way of derogation from the procedure provided for in paragraph 1, where the application of provisions concerning the principles of the regulatory system for transport would be liable to have a serious effect on the standard of living and on employment in certain areas and on the operation of transport facilities, they shall be laid down by the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. In so doing, the Council shall take into account the need for adaptation to the economic development which will result from establishing the common market.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
