<p> 13) Article 33 shall be replaced by the following: </p><p> &#039;Article 33</p><p> The Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction in actions brought by a Member State or by the Council to have decisions or recommendations of the Commission declared void on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers. The Court of Justice may not, however, examine the evaluation of the situation, resulting from economic facts or  circumstances, in the light of which the Commission took its decisions or made its recommendations, save where the Commission is  alleged to have misused its powers or to have manifestly failed to observe the provisions of this Treaty or any rule of law relating to its application. </p><p>  Undertakings or associations referred to in Article 48 may, under the same conditions, institute proceedings against decisions or recommendations concerning them which are individual in character or against general decisions or recommendations which they consider to involve a misuse of powers affecting them. </p><p>  The proceedings provided for in the first two paragraphs of this Article shall be instituted within one month of the notification or publication, as the case may be, of the decision or recommendation. </p><p>  The Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction under the same conditions in actions brought by the European Parliament for the purpose of protecting its prerogatives.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
