<p> Article J.4 </p><p> 1. The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the Union,  including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence. </p><p> 2. The Union requests the Western European Union (WEU), which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the  Union which have defence implications. The Council shall, in agreement with the institutions of the WEU, adopt the necessary practical arrangements. </p><p> 3. Issues having defence implications dealt with under this Article shall not be subject to the procedures set out in Article J.3. </p><p> 4. The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework. </p><p> 5. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the WEU and the Atlantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this Title. </p><p> 6. With a view to furthering the objective of this Treaty, and having in view the date of 1998 in the context of Article XII of the Brussels Treaty, the provisions of this Article may be revised as provided for in Article N(2) on the basis of a report to be presented in 1996 by the Council to the European Council, which shall include an evaluation of the progress made and the experience gained until then. </p><p>  </p>
