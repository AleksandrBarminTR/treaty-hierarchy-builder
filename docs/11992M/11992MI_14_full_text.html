<p> 14) The following Section shall be inserted: </p><p> &#039;Section V</p><p> The Court of Auditors</p><p> Article 160a</p><p>  The audit shall be carried out by the Court of Auditors. </p><p> Article 160b</p><p>  1. The Court of Auditors shall consist of twelve members. </p><p>  2. The members of the Court of Auditors shall be chosen from among persons who belong or have belonged in their respective countries to external audit bodies or who are especially qualified for this office. Their independence must be beyond doubt. </p><p>  3. The members of the Court of Auditors shall be appointed for a term of six years by the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament. </p><p>  However, when the first appointments are made, four members of the Court of Auditors, chosen by lot, shall be appointed for a term of office of four years only. </p><p>  The members of the Court of Auditors shall be eligible for reappointment. </p><p>  They shall elect the President of the Court of Auditors from among their number for a term of three years. The President may be re-elected. </p><p>  4. The members of the Court of Auditors shall, in the general interest of the Community, be completely independent in the performance of their duties. </p><p>  In the performance of these duties, they shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or from any other body. They shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties. </p><p>  5. The members of the Court of Auditors may not, during their term of office, engage in any other occupation, whether gainful or not. When entering upon their duties they shall give a solemn undertaking that, both during and after their term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom and in particular their duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits. </p><p>  6. Apart from normal replacement, or death, the duties of a member of the Court of Auditors shall end when he resigns, or is compulsorily retired by a ruling of the Court of Justice pursuant to paragraph 7. </p><p>  The vacancy thus caused shall be filled for the remainder of the member&#039;s term of office. </p><p>  Save in the case of compulsory retirement, members of the Court of Auditors shall remain in office until they have been replaced. </p><p>  7. A member of the Court of Auditors may be deprived of his office or of his right to a pension or other benefits in its stead only if the Court of Justice, at the request of the Court of Auditors, finds that he no longer fulfils the requisite conditions or meets the obligations arising from his office. </p><p>  8. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall determine the conditions of employment of the President and the members of the Court of Auditors and in particular their salaries, allowances and pensions. It shall also, by the  same majority, determine any payment to be made instead of remuneration. </p><p>  9. The provisions of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities applicable to the judges of the Court of Justice shall also apply to the members of the Court of Auditors. </p><p> Article 160c</p><p>  1. The Court of Auditors shall examine the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community. It shall also examine the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of all bodies set up by the Community insofar as the relevant constituent instrument does not preclude such examination. </p><p>  The Court of Auditors shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. </p><p>  2. The Court of Auditors shall examine whether all revenue has been received and all expenditure incurred in a lawful and regular manner and whether the financial management has been sound. </p><p>  The audit of revenue shall be carried out on the basis of the amounts established as due and the amounts actually paid to the Community. </p><p>  The audit of expenditure shall be carried out on the basis both of commitments undertaken and payments made. </p><p>  These audits may be carried out before the closure of accounts for the financial year in question. </p><p>  3. The audit shall be based on records and, if necessary, performed on the spot in the other institutions of the Community and in the Member States. In the Member States the audit shall be carried out in liaison with the national audit bodies or, if these do not have the necessary powers, with the competent national departments. These bodies or departments shall inform the Court of Auditors whether they intend to take part in the audit. </p><p>  The other institutions of the Community and the national audit bodies or, if these do not have the necessary powers, the competent national department, shall forward to the Court of Auditors, at its request, any document or information necessary to carry out its task. </p><p>  4. The Court of Auditors shall draw up an annual report after the close of each financial year. It shall be forwarded to the other institutions of the Community and shall be published, together with the replies of these institutions to the observations of the Court of Auditors, in the Official Journal of the European Communities. </p><p>  The Court of Auditors may also, at any time, submit observations, particularly in the form of special reports, on specific questions and deliver opinions at the request of one of the other institutions of the Community. </p><p>  It shall adopt its annual reports, special reports or opinions by a majority of its members. </p><p>  It shall assist the European Parliament and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementation of the budget.&#039;</p><p>  </p>
