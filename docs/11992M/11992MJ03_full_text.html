<p> Article J.3 </p><p> The procedure for adopting joint action in matters covered by the foreign and security policy shall be the following: </p><p> 1.  The Council shall decide, on the basis of general guidelines from the European Council, that a matter should be the subject of joint action. </p><p>  Whenever the Council decides on the principle of joint action, it shall lay down the specific scope, the Union&#039;s general and specific objectives in carrying out such action, if necessary its duration, and the means, procedures and conditions for its implementation. </p><p> 2.  The Council shall, when adopting the joint action and at any stage during its development, define those matters on which decisions are to be taken by a qualified majority. </p><p>  Where the Council is required to act by a qualified majority pursuant to the preceding subparagraph, the votes of its members shall be weighted in accordance with Article 148(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and for their adoption, acts of the Council shall require at least fifty-four votes in favour, cast by at least eight members. </p><p> 3.  If there is a change in circumstances having a substantial effect on a question subject to joint action, the Council shall review the principles and objectives of that action and take the necessary decisions. As long as the Council has not acted, the joint action shall stand. </p><p> 4.  Joint actions shall commit the Member States in the positions they adopt and in the conduct of their activity. </p><p> 5.  Whenever there is any plan to adopt a national position or take national action pursuant to a joint action, information shall be provided in time to allow, if necessary, for prior consultations within the Council. The obligation to provide prior information shall not apply to measures which are merely a national transposition of Council decisions. </p><p> 6.  In cases of imperative need arising from changes in the situation and failing a Council decision, Member States may take the necessary measures as a matter of urgency having regard to the general objectives of the joint action. The Member State concerned shall inform the Council immediately of any such measures. </p><p> 7.  Should there be any major difficulties in implementing a joint action, a Member State shall refer them to the Council which shall discuss them and seek appropriate solutions. Such solutions shall not run counter to the objectives of the joint action or impair its effectiveness. </p><p>  </p>
