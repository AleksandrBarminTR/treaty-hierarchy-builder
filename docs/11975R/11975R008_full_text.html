The Court of Auditors shall examine the account of all administrative expenditure and administrative revenue of the Community , including the revenue from the tax for the benefit of the Community levied on the salaries , wages and emoluments of officials and other servants of the latter . It shall also examine the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of all bodies set up by the Community in so far as the relevant constituent instrument does not preclude such examination .  </p><p>2 . The Court of Auditors shall examine whether all revenue referred to in paragraph 1 has been received and all expenditure referred to in that paragraph has been incurred in a lawful and regular manner and whether the financial management has been sound .  </p><p>The audit of revenue shall be carried out on the basis both of the amounts established as due and the amounts actually paid to the Community .  </p><p>The audit of expenditure shall be carried out on the basis both of commitments undertaken and payments made .  </p><p>These audits may be carried out before the closure of accounts for the financial year in question .  </p><p>3 . The audit shall be based on records and , if necessary , performed on the spot in the institutions of the Community and in the Member States . In the Member States the audit shall be carried out in liaison with the national audit bodies or , if these do not have the necessary powers , with the competent national departments . These bodies or departments shall inform the Court of Auditors whether they intend to take part in the audit .  </p><p>The institutions of the Community and the national audit bodies or , if these do not have the necessary powers , the competent national departments , shall forward to the Court of Auditors , at its request , any document or information necessary to carry out its task .  </p><p>4 . The Court of Auditors shall draw up an annual report after the close of each financial year . It shall be forwarded to the institutions of the Community and shall be published , together with the replies of these institutions to the observations of the Court of Auditors , in the Official Journal of the European Communities .  </p><p>The Court of Auditors may also , at any time , submit observations on specific questions and deliver opinions at the request of one of the institutions of the Community .  </p><p>It shall adopt its annual reports or opinions by a majority of its members .  </p><p>It shall assist the Assembly and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implemention of the budget .  </p><p>5 . The Court of Auditors shall also draw up a separate annual report stating whether the accounting other than that for the expenditure and revenue referred to in paragraph 1 and the financial management by the High Authority relating thereto have been effected in a regular manner . It shall draw up this report within six months of the end of the financial year to which the accounts refer and shall submit it to the High Authority and the Council . The High Authority shall forward it to the Assembly . &quot;  </p>
