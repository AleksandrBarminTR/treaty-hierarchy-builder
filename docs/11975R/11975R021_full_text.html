<p>++++</p><p>Article 21  </p><p>Article 178 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community is replaced by the following :  </p><p> &quot; Article 178  </p><p>If , at the beginning of a financial year , the budget has not yet been voted , a sum equivalent to not more than one-twelfth of the budget appropriations for the preceding financial year may be spent each month in respect of any chapter or other subdivision of the budget in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations made pursuant to Article 183 ; this arrangement shall not , however , have the effect of placing at the disposal of the Commission appropriations in excess of one-twelfth of those provided for in the draft budget in the course of preparation .  </p><p>The Council may , acting by a qualified majority , provided that the other conditions laid down in the first subparagraph are observed , authorize expenditure in excess of one-twelfth .  </p><p>If the decision relates to expenditure which does not necessarily result from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith , the Council shall forward it immediately to the Assembly ; within 30 days the Assembly , acting by a majority of its members and three-fifths of the votes cast , may adopt a different decision on the expenditure in excess of the one-twelfth referred to in the first subparagraph . This part of the decision of the Council shall be suspended until the Assembly has taken its decision . If , within this period , the Assembly has not taken a decision which differs from the decision of the Council , the latter shall be deemed to be finally adopted .  </p><p>The decisions referred to in the second and third subparagraphs shall lay down the necessary measures relating to resources to ensure application of this Article . &quot;  </p>
