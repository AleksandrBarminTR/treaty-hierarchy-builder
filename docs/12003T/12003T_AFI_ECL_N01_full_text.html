Consultations shall take place pursuant to a reasoned request by an acceding State, which shall set out expressly therein its interests as a future member of the Union and its observations.</p><p>3. Administrative decisions shall not, as a general rule, give rise to consultations.</p><p>4. Consultations shall take place within an Interim Committee composed of representatives of the Union and of the acceding States.</p><p>5. On the Union side, the members of the Interim Committee shall be the members of the Permanent Representatives Committee or persons designated by them for this purpose. The Commission shall be invited to be represented in this work.</p><p>6. The Interim Committee shall be assisted by a Secretariat, which shall be that of the Conference, continued for this purpose.</p><p>7. Consultations shall normally take place as soon as the preparatory work carried out at Union level with a view to the adoption of decisions by the Council has produced common guidelines enabling such consultations to be usefully arranged.</p><p>8. If serious difficulties remain after consultations, the matter may be raised at ministerial level at the request of an acceding State.</p><p>9. The above provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to the decisions of the Board of Governors of the European Investment Bank.</p><p>10. The procedure laid down in the above paragraphs shall also apply to any decision to be taken by the acceding States which might affect the commitments resulting from their position as future members of the Union.</p><p>II.</p><p>1. The procedure provided for under I shall apply mutatis mutandis to draft Council common strategies within the meaning of Article 13 of the TEU, draft Council joint actions within the meaning of Article 14 of the TEU and draft Council common positions within the meaning of Article 15 of the TEU, subject to the following provisions.</p><p>2.

Save for a reasoned objection from an acceding State, consultations may take place in the form of the exchange of messages by electronic means.</p><p>4. Should consultations take place within the Interim Committee, the Members of that Committee belonging to the Union may, where appropriate, be the Members of the Political and Security Committee.</p><p>III.</p><p>1.
