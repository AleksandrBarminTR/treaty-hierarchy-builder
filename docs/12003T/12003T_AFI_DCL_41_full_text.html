		<TXT_TE><p>41. Declaration by the Republic of Slovenia on the future regional division of the Republic of Slovenia</p><p>The Republic of Slovenia emphasises the importance it attaches to the balanced regional development and to the need to reduce socio-economic disparities between its regions.</p><p>The Republic of Slovenia notes that the competence for decisions on its regional division lies exclusively with the Republic of Slovenia. An exception to this is the regional division of Slovenia for the purposes of the common regional classification of the territorial units (NUTS).</p><p>In the context of the accession negotiations the issue of regional division of Slovenia at NUTS 2 level was provisionally settled at the nineteenth meeting of the Conference at Deputy level on 29 July 2002, under the terms set out in the Conclusions of the Conference. These Conclusions were confirmed at the Ministerial meeting of the Accession Conference on 1 October 2002.</p><p>A declaration by the Republic of Slovenia, to which none of the Member States objected at any stage, was included in the Conclusions of the Conference and the relevant part of it reads:</p><p>"Slovenia is pleased to note that the EU noted that the whole territory of Slovenia will be considered as one single region at NUTS 2 level for the period up to the end of 2006, that Slovenia intends to implement one Single Programming Document covering the whole territory of Slovenia for the programming period up to the end of 2006, and that Slovenia will continue discussions on the territorial division ensuring balanced regional development with the Commission in order to review, already being a Member State, its NUTS classification at the end of 2006 at the latest.</p><p>If the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for statistics (NUTS) is adopted and enters into force before Slovenia's accession, Slovenia will, if necessary, negotiate with the EU its application to the territorial division of Slovenia.</p><p>On this basis Slovenia can accept the EU proposal and agree that at this stage this chapter does not require further negotiation."</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
