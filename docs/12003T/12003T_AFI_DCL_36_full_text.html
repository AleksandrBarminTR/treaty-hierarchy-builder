		<TXT_TE><p>36. Declaration by the Republic of Malta on the island region of Gozo</p><p>The Government of Malta,</p><p>Noting that the island region of Gozo has economic and social specificities as well as handicaps arising from the combined effects of its double insularity, its environmental fragility, its small population size coupled with a high population density as well as its inherent limited resources,</p><p>Noting that the Gross Domestic Product per capita of the island region of Gozo is significantly lower than that of Malta as a whole,</p><p>Noting that it is pursuing specific economic and social policies with regard to the island region of Gozo, the object of which is to overcome the permanent structural handicaps from which it suffers,</p><p>Recognising that, upon the accession of Malta to the European Union, as a result of the agreement regarding the eligibility of Malta for the Structural Funds Objectives and for Cohesion Fund assistance, as well as of the agreements regarding the VAT zero-rate for inter-island passenger transport and the transitional period for the inter-island transport of agricultural goods, Gozo will be benefiting from measures which specifically address its structural handicaps, in addition to participating in measures of more general economic and social benefit,</p><p>Recognising further that the NUTS 3 classification accorded to the island region of Gozo may not, on its own, ensure implementation of the European Union's stated commitment to take measures for the benefit of less-favoured regions,</p><p>Declares that, before the end of each Community budgetary period entailing a redefinition of the Community regional policy, Malta will request that the Commission report to the Council on the economic and social situation of Gozo and, in particular, on the disparities in the social and economic development levels between Gozo and Malta. The Commission would be asked to propose appropriate measures, as required, in the framework of the Community regional policy or other relevant Community policies, to ensure the continuation of the reduction of disparities between Gozo and Malta as well as the further integration of Gozo into the internal market on fair conditions. In particular, in the event that Malta, as a whole, would no longer be eligible to certain measures of the regional policy, the report would assess whether the specific economic situation of Gozo justifies a continued eligibility of Gozo to those measures, and under which conditions, during the reference period.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
