		<TXT_TE><p>Article 17</p><p>In Protocol No 18 on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the following paragraph shall be added to Article 49:</p><p>"49.3 Upon one or more countries becoming Member States and their respective national central banks becoming part of the ESCB, the subscribed capital of the ECB and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred to the ECB shall be automatically increased. The increase shall be determined by multiplying the respective amounts then prevailing by the ratio, within the expanded capital key, between the weighting of the entering national central banks concerned and the weighting of the national central banks already members of the ESCB. Each national central bank's weighting in the capital key shall be calculated by analogy with Article 29.1 and in compliance with Article 29.2. The reference periods to be used for the statistical data shall be identical to those applied for the latest quinquennial adjustment of the weightings under Article 29.3."</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
