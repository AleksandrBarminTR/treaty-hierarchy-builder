		<TXT_TE><p>38. Declaration by the Republic of Poland concerning competitiveness of the Polish production of some fruit</p><p>Poland takes note that covering Poland with the EU common customs tariff can result in an adverse and immediate outcome for the competitiveness of Polish producers of soft fruits, sour cherries and apples. If after the accession difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in those sectors, Poland will request urgent application of the general safeguard clause and will request adoption of instruments allowing for permanent removal of disturbances of the competitiveness in the sector of soft fruits, sour cherries and apples.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
