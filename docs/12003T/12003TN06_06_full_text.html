This may include the possibility of full liberalisation;</p><p>(f) The effect of the application of paragraphs (a) to (d) shall not lead to more restrictive access to national road haulage services than that prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
