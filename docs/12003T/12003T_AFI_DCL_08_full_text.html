		<TXT_TE><p>8. Declaration on oil shale, the internal electricity market and Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (Electricity Directive): Estonia</p><p>The Union will closely monitor that Estonia fulfils its commitments notably with regard to the further preparation to the internal energy market (oil shale sector restructuring, electricity sector restructuring, legislation, strengthening Energy Market Inspectorate, etc).</p><p>The Union draws Estonia's attention to the conclusions of the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils, related to accelerated market opening in — among others — the electricity and gas sectors, with the aim of achieving a fully operational internal market in these areas, and notes Estonia's earlier statements made in this regard on 27 May 2002 in the context of the accession negotiations. Notwithstanding the need for the early implementation of an operational internal electricity market, the Union takes note that Estonia reserves its position regarding future legislative developments in this area. The Union recognises in this respect the specific situation related to the restructuring of the oil shale sector which will require particular efforts until the end of 2012, and the need for gradual opening of the Estonian electricity market for non-household customers until that date.</p><p>The Union notes that, with a view to limiting the potential distortion of competition in the internal electricity market, safeguard mechanisms, such as the reciprocity clause of Directive 96/92/EC, may have to be applied.</p><p>The Commission will closely monitor the development of the electricity production and the possible changes in the electricity market in Estonia and in the neighbouring countries.</p><p>Without prejudice to the above, any Member State may from 2009 onwards request the Commission to assess the development of the electricity markets of the Baltic Sea area. Based on this assessment, with full consideration to the unique character of oil shale and social and economic considerations related to the extraction, production and consumption of oil shale in Estonia, and taking into account the objectives of the Community regarding the electricity market, the Commission shall report to the Council with appropriate recommendations.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
