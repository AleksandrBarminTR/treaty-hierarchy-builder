		<TXT_TE><p>3. FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL</p><p>Treaty on European Union;</p><p>Treaty establishing the European Community.</p><p>Notwithstanding the obligations under the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, Latvia may maintain in force for seven years from the date of accession the rules laid down in its legislation existing at the time of signature of this Act regarding the acquisition of agricultural land and forests by nationals of the Member States and by companies formed in accordance with the laws of another Member State and being neither established nor registered nor having a local branch or agency in Latvia. In no instance may a national of a Member State be treated less favourably in respect of the acquisition of agricultural land and forests than at the date of signature of the Accession Treaty or be treated in a more restrictive way than a national of a third country.</p><p>Nationals of another Member State who wish to establish themselves as self-employed farmers and reside in Latvia, and who have been legally resident and active in farming in Latvia for at least three years continuously, shall not be subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph or to any procedures other than those to which nationals of Latvia are subject.</p><p>A general review of these transitional measures shall be held in the third year following the date of accession. To this effect, the Commission shall submit a report to the Council. The Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, decide to shorten or terminate the transitional period indicated in the first paragraph.</p><p>If there is sufficient evidence that, upon expiry of the transitional period, there will be serious disturbances or a threat of serious disturbances on the agricultural land market of Latvia, the Commission, at the request of Latvia, shall decide upon the extension of the transitional period for up to a maximum of three years.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
