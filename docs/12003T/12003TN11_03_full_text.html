This operating aid element of the plan decreases over time, so that no more than 25 % of the amount actually paid out may be paid out during the last four years of the restructuring plan.</p><p>The aid for each item shall not exceed the cost it is intended to cover, and shall be limited to the minimum necessary to attain the objectives of the restructuring plan.</p><p>(b) Malta shall implement the restructuring of the shipyards on the basis of a restructuring plan which aims at achieving full viability no later than by the end of the restructuring period, and which respects the following conditions:</p><p>(i) the aid shall only be granted once. No further aid shall be granted to the company owning the shipyards after 31 December 2008;</p><p>(ii) the man-hours available for the planned productive workforce for shipbuilding, ship repair and ship conversion of 1410 persons (after the restructuring) within the shipyards shall be 2,4 million man hours per annum;</p><p>(iii) the number of sold man-hours for ship-repair and ship-conversion shall not exceed 2035000 for any of the ten years following the beginning of the restructuring period;</p><p>(iv) shipbuilding, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 establishing new rules on aid to shipbuilding [3], shall not exceed a maximum annual production of 10000 compensated gross tonnage. The shipyards may deduct from their reported output the following operations which can be shown to have been outsourced: erection of scaffolding, internal transport, provisional services, guard services, construction of fixtures and models, ship cleaning services, insulation and laminating, bilge and ballast systems, fire-extinguishing and sprinkler systems, cableways (if not part of e-installation), e-installation (because of the generally high proportion of material costs they involve only 40 % of documented costs shall be taken into account for these operations), rigging, locksmithery, mechanical processing, sanitation (excluding sanitary cells) and heating;</p><p>The total compensated gross tonnage of the shipbuilding contract in question may be reduced by the percentage accounted for by the above mentioned outsourced operations.</p><p>(v) dock 1 of Malta Drydocks shall be closed to shipbuilding, ship conversion and ship repair for at least ten years from the date of the start of the restructuring period. If the closed dock is re-used for other activities, these must be independent of the companies owning the shipyards at present, and must not be related to shipbuilding, ship repair or ship conversion;</p><p>(vi) with regard to the required reduction in manpower of the yards, Malta shall ensure that the necessary core workforce with the essential skill levels is retained;</p><p>(vii) training programmes associated with the restructuring plan must be compatible with the generally applicable Community rules;</p><p>(viii) any aid granted in breach of the above conditions shall be reimbursed.</p><p>(c) If viability for the shipyards cannot be achieved owing to exceptional circumstances unforeseen at the time the restructuring plan was drawn up, the Commission may review the conditions set out in (b) above in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 88(1) of the EC Treaty. Before beginning this procedure, the Commission shall take full account of the views of Member States on the existence of exceptional circumstances. These views shall be expressed on the basis of a Commission recommendation and on the basis of available relevant information and circumstances.</p><p>The overall aid amount referred to in (a) above shall not be exceeded under any circumstances.</p><p>(d) Malta shall cooperate with the monitoring arrangements established by the Commission, including on-site inspections by independent experts, during the restructuring period.</p><p>Malta shall supply to the Commission yearly reports on the implementation of the plan. The reports shall include all relevant information to enable the Commission to assess the situation with regard to the implementation of the restructuring programme, including the pricing behaviour of the yards for new ship-repair and shipbuilding contracts obtained by the yards. The shipyard's yearly production report must specify the compensated gross tonnage of eligible outsourced works according to the actual period of time over which they were carried out by third parties and include this in the calculation of the compensated gross tonnage of the shipbuilding contract. In the case of ships the construction of which extends over two years, the compensated gross tonnage figure shall be frozen at the end of the year in order to prevent retroactive corrections. The shipyard must also be able to produce all contracts relating to the outsourcing of works contained in the list in subparagraph (b) (iv) for verification purposes.</p><p>Malta shall provide these reports within two months of the end of each year, beginning in March 2003. The last report shall be submitted by the end of March 2009, unless agreed otherwise by the Commission and Malta.</p><p>[1] Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ L 107, 30.4.1996, p. 4).</p><p>[2] OJ C 74, 10.3.1998, p. 9.</p><p>[3] OJ L 202, 18.7.1998, p. 1.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
