Such applications shall only contain data on applicants and on declared agricultural parcels (identification number and area);</p><p>- put in place a land parcel identification system so as to ensure that the parcels for which aid applications have been made can be identified and their area established, that the parcels concern agricultural land and that they are not the subject of another application;</p><p>- have in place a computerised database for agricultural holdings, parcels and aid applications;</p><p>- check the aid applications in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92.</p><p>The application of the single area payment scheme shall not in any way affect the obligation of any new Member State with regard to the implementation of Community rules on the identification and registration of animals as provided for by Directive 92/102/EEC [****] Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals (OJ L 355, 5.12.1992, p. 32). and Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 [*****] Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 (OJ L 204, 11.8.2000, p. 1).".</p><p>9. For any new Member State the single area payment scheme shall be available for a period of application until the end of 2006 with the possibility of renewal twice by one year at the new Member State's request. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 11, any new Member State may decide to terminate the application of the scheme at the end of the first or the second year of the period of application. New Member States shall notify the Commission of their intention to terminate at least two months before the end of the last year of application.</p><p>10. Before the end of the period of application of the single area payment scheme, the Commission shall assess the state of preparedness of the new Member State concerned to apply fully the support schemes referred to in Article 1.</p><p>In particular, by the end of the period of application of the single area payment scheme, the new Member State shall have taken all necessary steps to set up the IACS laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 for running properly the support schemes referred to in Article 1 in the form then applicable.</p><p>11. On the basis of its assessment, the Commission shall:</p><p>(a) note that the new Member State can enter the system of support schemes referred to in Article 1 applied in the present Member States,</p><p>or</p><p>(b) decide to extend the application of the single area payment scheme by the new Member State for the period estimated necessary to allow for the necessary management and control procedures to be fully in place and to function properly.</p><p>Before the end of the extended application period referred to in (b), paragraph 11 shall apply.</p><p>Until the end of the 5 year period of application of the single area payment scheme (i.e. 2008), the percentage rate set out in Article 1a shall apply. If the application of the single area payment scheme is extended beyond that date pursuant to a decision taken under (b), the percentage rate set out in Article 1a for the year 2008 shall apply until the end of the last year of application of the single area payment scheme.</p><p>12. After the end of the period of application of the single area payment scheme, the support schemes referred to in Article 1 shall be applied according to the relevant Community rules and on the basis of the quantitative parameters, such as base area, premium ceilings and Maximum Guaranteed Quantities (MGQ), specified in the Act of Accession for each support scheme, without prejudice to possible changes arising from amendments to the relevant Community legislation. The percentage rates set out in Article 1a for the relevant years shall subsequently apply.</p><p>13. New Member States shall inform the Commission in detail of the measures taken to implement this Article and in particular the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 7.</p><p>14. The single area payment scheme shall be considered as intervention as referred to in Article 1(2)(b) and Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 [******] Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 103)..</p><p>Article 1c</p><p>Complementary national direct payments and direct payments in the new Member States</p><p>1. For the purposes of this Article: "CAP-like national scheme" shall mean any national direct payment scheme applicable prior to the date of accession of the new Member States under which the support was granted to farmers in respect of production covered by one of the EU direct payment schemes listed in Annex I.</p><p>2. The new Member States shall have the possibility, subject to authorisation by the Commission, of complementing direct aid paid to a farmer under any CAP scheme listed in Annex I up to:</p><p>- 55 % of the level of direct payments in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004 in 2004, 60 % in 2005 and 65 % in 2006 and from 2007 up to 30 percentage points above the applicable level referred to in Article 1a in the relevant year. However, in the potato starch sector the Czech Republic may throughout the entire period of phasing in of direct payments top up to 100 % of the level of direct payments in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004 in the relevant year,</p><p>or</p><p>- the total level of direct support the farmer would have been entitled to receive, on a product by product basis, in the new Member State in the calendar year 2003 under a CAP-like national scheme increased by 10 percentage points. However for Lithuania the reference year shall be the calendar year 2002 and for Slovenia the increase shall be 10 percentage points in 2004, 15 percentage points in 2005, 20 percentage points in 2006 and 25 percentage points from 2007.</p><p>For each CAP scheme concerned the new Member States may choose to apply one of the two abovementioned options.</p><p>The total direct support the farmer may be granted in the new Member States after accession under the relevant EU scheme including all complementary national direct payments shall not exceed the level of direct support the farmer would be entitled to receive under the corresponding EU scheme then applicable to the Member States in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004.</p><p>3. Cyprus may complement direct aid paid to a farmer under any CAP scheme listed in Annex I up to the total level of support the farmer would have been entitled to receive in Cyprus in 2001.</p><p>The Cypriot authorities shall ensure that the total direct support the farmer is granted after accession in Cyprus under the relevant EU scheme including all complementary national direct payments in no case exceeds the level of direct support the farmer would be entitled to receive under that scheme in the relevant year in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004.</p><p>The total amounts of complementary national aid to be granted shall be those indicated in Annex II.</p><p>The complementary national aid to be granted shall be subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary by developments in the common agricultural policy.</p><p>The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 5 shall not apply to Cyprus.</p><p>4. If a new Member State decides to apply the single area payment scheme, that new Member State may grant complementary national direct aid under the conditions referred to in paragraphs 5 and 8.</p><p>5. The total amount per sector of complementary national aid granted in a given year when applying the single area payment scheme shall be limited by a specific financial envelope per sector. This envelope shall be equal to the difference between:</p><p>- the total amount of support per sector resulting from the application of the first or second indent of paragraph 2, as appropriate, and</p><p>- the total amount of direct support that would be available in the relevant new Member State for the same sector in the year concerned under the single area payment scheme.</p><p>6. The new Member State may decide on the basis of objective criteria and after authorisation by the Commission, on the amounts of complementary national aid to be granted.</p><p>7. The authorisation by the Commission shall:</p><p>- where paragraph 2, second indent applies, specify the relevant CAP-like national direct payment schemes,</p><p>- define the level up to which the complementary national aid may be paid, the rate of the complementary national aid and, where appropriate, the conditions for the granting thereof,</p><p>- be granted subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary by developments in the common agricultural policy.</p><p>8. No complementary national payments or aid shall be granted for agricultural activities covered by a common market organisation not directly supported by a support scheme referred to in Article 1.</p><p>9. Cyprus may, in addition to the complementary national direct payments, grant transitional and degressive national aid until the end of 2010. This State aid shall be granted in a form similar to Community aid, such as decoupled payments.</p><p>Taking into account the nature and amount of national support granted in 2001, Cyprus may grant State aid to the (sub)sectors listed in Annex III and up to the amounts specified in that Annex.</p><p>The State aid to be granted shall be subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary by developments in the common agricultural policy. Should such adjustments prove necessary, the amount of the aid or the conditions for the granting thereof shall be amended on the basis of a decision by the Commission.</p><p>Cyprus shall submit an annual report to the Commission on the implementation of the State aid measures, indicating the aid forms and amounts per (sub)sector.</p><p>10. Latvia may, in addition to the complementary national direct payments, grant transitional and degressive national aid until the end of 2008. This State aid shall be granted in a form similar to Community aid, such as decoupled payments.</p><p>Latvia may grant State aid to the (sub)sectors listed in Annex IV up to the amounts specified in that Annex.</p><p>The State aid to be granted shall be subject to any adjustments which may be rendered necessary by developments in the common agricultural policy. Should such adjustments prove necessary, the amount of the aid or the conditions for the granting thereof shall be amended on the basis of a decision by the Commission.</p><p>Latvia shall submit an annual report to the Commission on the implementation of the State aid measures, indicating the aid forms and amounts per (sub)sector.</p><p>(c) The following paragraph is added to Article 2a:</p><p>"8. The simplified scheme shall not apply to the new Member States."</p><p>;</p><p>(d) Article 11(4) is replaced by the following:</p><p>"4. In accordance with paragraph 2, the Commission shall adopt:</p><p>- detailed rules for the application of Article 2a, including any derogation from the relevant regulations and Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 [], which are necessary to achieve the aim of simplification, in particular those relating to eligibility conditions, dates of application and payment and control provisions as well as detailed rules in order to avoid double claims in respect of the area and production covered by the simplified scheme,</p><p>- detailed rules relating to the implementation of the single area payment scheme set out in Article 1b,</p><p>- such amendments to Annex I as may become necessary taking into account the criteria set out in Article 1, and</p><p>- where appropriate, detailed rules for the application of this Regulation including, in particular, the measures necessary to avoid the circumvention of Articles 3 and 4, as well as those concerning Article 7.</p><p>(e) The title of the Annex
