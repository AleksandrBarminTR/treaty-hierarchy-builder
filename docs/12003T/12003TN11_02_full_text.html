Article 39 of the EC Treaty shall fully apply only, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers in Malta, subject to the transitional provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 4.</p><p>2. Malta may resort to the procedures set out in the subparagraphs below until the end of the seven year period following the date of accession.</p><p>When Malta undergoes or foresees disturbances on its labour market which could seriously threaten the standard of living or level of employment in a given region or occupation, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof and shall supply them with all relevant particulars. On the basis of this information, Malta may request the Commission to state that the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 be wholly or partially suspended, in order to restore to normal the situation in that region or occupation. The Commission shall decide on the suspension and on the duration and scope thereof not later than two weeks after receiving such a request and shall notify the Council of such a decision. Any Member State may, within two weeks from the date of the Commission's Decision, request the Council to annul or amend the Decision. The Council shall act on such a request within two weeks, by qualified majority.</p><p>Malta may, in urgent and exceptional cases, suspend the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, followed by a reasoned ex-post notification to the Commission.</p><p>3. In order to have advance notice of any situation that may require action in accordance with paragraph 2 above during the seven year period following the date of accession, Malta may also retain its work permit system for nationals of other Member States for whom Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 apply, but shall issue such work permits automatically.</p><p>4. In so far as certain provisions of Directive 68/360/EEC may not be dissociated from those of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 whose application may be suspended pursuant to paragraph 2, Malta may derogate from those provisions to the extent necessary for the application of paragraph 2.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
