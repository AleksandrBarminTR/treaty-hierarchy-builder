		<TXT_TE><p>32. Declaration by the Republic of Latvia on fisheries</p><p>With respect to Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 establishing the share of Community fishing opportunities to be allocated to Member States for stocks, which are regulated by a catch limit, Latvia understands that the specific provisions of this Act related to fishing opportunities to be allocated to Latvia in the Baltic Sea refer to the existing management system within the IBSFC as it is calculated for the EU-15 and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.</p><p>With regard to the fishing opportunities within the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Latvia declares its interests for fishing in that area, although it has no significant catch record during the recent period. Latvia as a cooperative party to the NEAFC, respecting all the decisions and regulations set by this Commission, expects that its interests will be duly taken into account when allocating the fishing opportunities to Latvia and other new Member States.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
