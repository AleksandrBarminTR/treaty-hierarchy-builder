		<TXT_TE><p>7. Declaration on the free movement of workers: Estonia</p><p>The EU stresses the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the arrangement for the free movement of workers. Member States shall endeavour to grant increased labour market access to Estonian nationals under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis. As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the EU for Estonian nationals should improve substantially upon Estonia's accession. Moreover, the EU Member States will make best use of the proposed arrangement to move as quickly as possible to the full application of the acquis in the area of free movement of workers.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
