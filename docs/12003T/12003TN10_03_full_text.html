		<TXT_TE><p>3. FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL</p><p>Treaty on European Union;</p><p>Treaty establishing the European Community.</p><p>1. Notwithstanding the obligations under the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, Hungary may maintain in force for five years from the date of accession the restrictions laid down in its legislation existing at the time of signature of this Act on the acquisition of secondary residences.</p><p>Nationals of the Member States and nationals of the States which are a party to the European Economic Area Agreement who have been legally resident in Hungary at least for four years continuously shall not be subject to the provisions of the preceding subparagraph or to any rules and procedures other than those to which nationals of Hungary are subject. During the transitional period Hungary shall apply authorisation procedures for the acquisition of secondary residences based on objective, stable, transparent and public criteria. These criteria shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner and shall not differentiate between nationals of the Member States residing in Hungary.</p><p>2. Notwithstanding the obligations under the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, Hungary may maintain in force for seven years from the date of accession the prohibitions laid down in its legislation existing at the time of signature of this Act on the acquisition of agricultural land by natural persons who are non-residents or non-nationals of Hungary and by legal persons. In no instance may nationals of the Member States or legal persons formed in accordance with the laws of another Member State be treated less favourably in respect of the acquisition of agricultural land than at the date of signature of the Accession Treaty. In no instance may a national of a Member State be treated in a more restrictive way than a national from a third country.</p><p>Nationals of another Member State who want to establish themselves as self-employed farmers and who have been legally resident and active in farming in Hungary at least for three years continuously, shall not be subject to the provisions of the preceding subparagraph or to any rules and procedures other than those to which nationals of Hungary are subject.</p><p>A general review of these transitional measures shall be held in the third year following the date of accession. To this effect, the Commission shall submit a report to the Council. The Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, decide to shorten or terminate the transitional period indicated in the first subparagraph of point 2.</p><p>Should Hungary apply authorisation procedures for the acquisition of agricultural land during the transitional period, they shall be based on objective, stable, transparent and public criteria. These criteria shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner and shall not differentiate between nationals of the Member States residing in Hungary.</p><p>If there is sufficient evidence that, upon expiry of the transitional period, there will be serious disturbances or a threat of serious disturbances on the agricultural land market of Hungary, the Commission, at the request of Hungary, shall decide upon the extension of the transitional period for up to a maximum of three years.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
