		<TXT_TE><p>44. Declaration by the Commission of the European Communities to the conclusions of the Accession Conference with Latvia</p><p>The treatment of abandoned land, for example to return land to traditional environmental conditions and/or to prevent closed landscapes, can be supported as a measure under Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 in the Single Programming Document under Objective I.</p><p>Article 33 offers different possibilities in this regard; e.g. under the eighth indent for agricultural water resources management, but in particular under the eleventh indent, which says that support can be provided for protection of the environment in connection with agriculture, forestry and landscape conservation as well as with the improvement of animal welfare. This support could be in the form of a single payment for environmentally-friendly treatment of abandoned land.</p><p>The proposed measure should not include as a specific aim the return of land to agricultural production covered by Common Market Organisations or to set-aside. However, land owned by farmers and treated as described above could be used by those farmers in combination with their existing farmland, in order to modify their current agricultural production methods in ways designed to protect the environment and to maintain the countryside. In this case further support may be possible under the agri-environment measure referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
