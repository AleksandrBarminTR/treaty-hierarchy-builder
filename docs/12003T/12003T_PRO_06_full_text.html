		<TXT_TE><p>Protocol No 6</p><p>on the acquisition of secondary residences in Malta</p><p>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p><p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p><p>Bearing in mind the very limited number of residences in Malta and the very limited land available for construction purposes, which can only cover the basic needs created by the demographic development of the present residents, Malta may on a non-discriminatory basis maintain in force the rules on the acquisition and holding of immovable property for secondary residence purposes by nationals of the Member States who have not legally resided in Malta for at least five years laid down in the Immovable Property (Acquisition by Non-Residents) Act (Chapter 246).</p><p>Malta shall apply authorisation procedures for the acquisition of immovable property for secondary residence purposes in Malta, which shall be based on published, objective, stable and transparent criteria. These criteria shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner and shall not differentiate between nationals of Malta and of other Member States. Malta shall ensure that in no instance shall a national of a Member State be treated in a more restrictive way than a national of a third country.</p><p>In the event that the value of one such property bought by a national of a Member State exceeds the thresholds provided for in Malta's legislation, namely 30000 Maltese lira for apartments and 50000 Maltese lira for any type of property other than apartments and property of historical importance, authorisation shall be granted. Malta may revise the thresholds established by such legislation to reflect changes in prices in the property market in Malta.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
