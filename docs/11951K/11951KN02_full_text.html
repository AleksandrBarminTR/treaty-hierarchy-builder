Each Member State shall authorize the shipment from its territory to other Member States of tonnages in accordance with the allocation made by the Commission; in return, each Member State shall be authorized to effect the necessary checks to establish that outgoing shipments are not in excess of the amounts provided for. The Commission is empowered to ensure that the arrangements made are not more restrictive than is necessary for this purpose.</p><p>2. The allocation among Member States shall be reviewed at as frequent intervals as may be necessary to maintain a relation fair both to local purchasers and to purchasers from other Member States between the recorded availabilities in each Member State and the tonnages it is required to ship to other Member States.</p><p>3. The Commission shall ensure that the regulations made by each Member State concerning sellers within its jurisdiction do not lead to the application of dissimilar conditions to comparable transactions, especially on grounds of the nationality of the buyers.</p><p>  </p>
