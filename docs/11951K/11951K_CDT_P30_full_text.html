In view of the special position of the Italian steel industry, the Commission is empowered to authorize the Italian Government to continue, to the necessary extent during the transitional period defined in Article 1 of this Convention, to charge customs duties on steel products from other Member States; however, in the first year of the transitional period these may not exceed the rates of duty under the Annecy Convention of 10 October 1949, this ceiling being reduced by 10% in the second year, 25% in the third, 45% in the fourth and 70% in the fifth, and the duties being abolished altogether at the end of the transitional period.</p><p>2. The prices charged by undertakings for sales of steel on the Italian market, when reduced to their equivalents at the point chosen for their price lists, may not be lower than the prices shown in the lists in question for comparable transactions, save where authorized by the Commission in agreement with the Italian Government, without prejudice to the last subparagraph of Article 60(2)(b).</p><p>  </p>
