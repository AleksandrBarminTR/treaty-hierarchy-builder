Within the ceiling defined above, it shall calculate the amount to be actually levied in such a way that the government subsidies to be actually paid shall be at least equal to that amount;</p><p>2. It shall fix the maximum permitted amount of the government subsidies, on the understanding that:</p><p> - the governments may, but need not, grant subsidies up to that amount;</p><p> - aid received from outside may in no circumstances exceed the amount of the subsidy actually paid.</p><p>Extra charges in connection with exports to third countries shall be allowed for neither in calculating the equalization payments required nor in assessing the offsetting subsidies.</p><p>  </p>
