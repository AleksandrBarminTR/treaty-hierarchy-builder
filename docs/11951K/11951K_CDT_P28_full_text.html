<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Convention on the Transitional Provisions - Part Three - General safeguards - Chapter 2 - Special provisions for coal - France - Article 28</p><p>1. It is agreed that coal production in the French mines:</p><p>- need not be reduced each year by more than one million metric tons as compared with the level of the preceding year if total Community production is the same or is above the level of the preceding year; or,</p><p>- if total Community production is below the level of the preceding year, need not be lower than the figure obtained by applying to the level of French production in the preceding year less one million metric tons the same coefficient of decrease as that in total Community production.</p><p>2. To ensure that shifts in production levels are kept within these limits, the arrangements referred to in Article 24 of this Convention may be supplemented by the exceptional expedient of a special levy imposed by the Commission on increases in the net deliveries from other collieries as shown in French customs statistics, to the extent that these increases represent shifts in production levels.</p><p>Accordingly, the levy shall be chargeable on the amounts by which net deliveries in each period exceed those in 1950, up to the amount of the decrease in the coal production of French mines since 1950 or, if total Community production is also down, to the figure obtained by applying to that amount the same coefficient of decrease as that in total Community production. The special levy shall be fixed at a maximum of 10% of the producers&#039; receipts on the amounts in question and shall be used, in agreement with the Commission, to reduce, in the appropriate zones, the price for certain coals produced by the French mines.</p><p>  </p>
