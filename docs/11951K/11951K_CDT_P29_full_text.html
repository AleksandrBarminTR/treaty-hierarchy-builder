<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Convention on the Transitional Provisions - Part Three - General safeguards - Chapter 3 - Special provisions for the steel industry - Article 29</p><p>1. It is agreed that, during the transitional period, special safeguards may be necessary in the case of the steel industry to ensure that shifts in production levels due to the establishment of the common market neither create difficulties for undertakings which would be in a position to meet compe tition following the adaptation provided for in Article 1 of this Convention, nor lead to more redundancies than can benefit under Article 23. Where the Commission finds that the provisions of the Treaty, and in particular Articles 57, 58, 59 and 60(2)(b), cannot be applied, it is empowered, in the following order of preference:</p><p>(a) after consulting the Consultative Committee and the Council, to limit by direct or indirect means the net increase in deliveries from one area to another within the common market;</p><p>(b) after consulting the Consultative Committee and with the assent of the Council both as to the advisability and the details of the proposed action, to use the powers of intervention provided in Article 61(b), but, by way of derogation from that Article, without the requirement that a manifest crisis should exist or be imminent;</p><p>(c) after consulting the Consultative Committee and with the assent of the Council, to establish a system of production quotas, which shall not, however, affect production for export;</p><p>(d) after consulting the Consultative Committee and with the assent of the Council, to authorize a Member State to take the steps referred to in the sixth paragraph of Article 15 of this Convention, in the manner provided therein.</p><p>2. For the purpose of applying these provisions, the Commission shall during the preparatory period defined in Article 1 of this Convention, in consultation with associations of producers, the Consultative Committee and the Council, fix the technical details for the application of the safeguard arrangements.</p><p>3. If during part of the transitional period, either because of a shortage, or because the funds earned by undertakings or placed at their disposal are insufficient, or because of exceptional circumstances not now foreseeable, it has not been possible to effect the necessary adaptation of or alterationsin production conditions, the provisions of this Article may, after the Consultative Committee has been consulted and the assent of the Council obtained, be applied after the end of the transitional period for as long as, but no longer than, this state of affairs continues, up to a maximum of two years.</p><p>  </p>
