<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Title III - Economic and social provisions - Chapter 7 - Interference with conditions of competition - Article 67</p><p>1. Any action by a Member State which is liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the coal or the steel industry shall be brought to the knowledge of the Commission by the government concerned.</p><p>2. If the action is liable, by substantially increasing differences in production costs otherwise than through changes in productivity, to provoke a serious disequilibrium, the Commission, after consulting the Consultative Committee and the Council, may take the following steps:</p><p>- if the action taken by that State is having harmful effects on the coal or steel undertakings within the jurisdiction of that State, the Commission may authorize it to grant aid to these undertakings, the amount, conditions and duration of which shall be determined in agreement with the Commission. The same shall apply in the case of any change in wages and working conditions which would have the same effects, even if not resulting from any action by that State;</p><p>- if the action taken by that State is having harmful effects on the coal or steel undertakings within the jurisdiction of other Member States, the Commission shall make a recommendation to that State with a view to remedying these effects by such measures as that State may consider most compatible with its own economic equilibrium.</p><p>3. If the action taken by that State reduces differences in production costs by allowing special benefits to or imposing special charges on the coal or steel undertakings within its jurisdiction in comparison with the other industries in the same country, the Commission is empowered to make the necessary recommendations to that State after consulting the Consultative Committee and the Council.</p><p>  </p>
