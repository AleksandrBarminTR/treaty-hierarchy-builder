<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Title III - Economic and social provisions - Chapter 4 - Production - Article 58</p><p>1. In the event of a decline in demand, if the Commission considers that the Community is confronted with a period of manifest crisis and that the means of action provided for in Article 57 are not sufficient to deal with this, it shall, after consulting the Consultative Committee and with the assent of the Council, establish a system of production quotas, accompanied to the necessary extent by the measures provided for in Article 74.</p><p>If the Commission fails to act, a Member State may bring the matter before the Council, which may, acting unanimously, require the Commission to establish a system of quotas.</p><p>2. The Commission shall, on the basis of studies made jointly with undertakings and associations of undertakings, determine the quotas on an equitable basis, taking account of the principles set out in Articles 2, 3 and 4. It may in particular regulate the level of activity of undertakings by appropriate levies on tonnages exceeding a reference level set by a general decision.</p><p>The funds thus obtained shall be used to support undertakings whose rate of production has fallen below that envisaged, in order, in particular, to maintain employment in these undertakings as far as possible.</p><p>3. The system of quotas shall be ended on a proposal made to the Council by the Commission after consulting the Consultative Committee, or by the government of a Member State, unless the Council decides otherwise, acting unanimously if the proposal emanates from the Commission or by a simple majority if the proposal emanates from a government. An announcement on the ending of the quota system shall be made by the Commission.</p><p>4. The Commission may impose upon undertakings which do not comply with decisions taken by it under this Article fines not exceeding the value of the tonnages produced in disregard thereof. </p><p>  </p>
