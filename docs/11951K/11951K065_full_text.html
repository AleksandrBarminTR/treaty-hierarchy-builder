<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Title III - Economic and social provisions - Chapter 6 - Agreements and Concentrations - Article 65</p><p>1. All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices tending directly or indirectly to prevent,restrict or distort normal competition within the common market shall be prohibited, and in particular those tending:</p><p>(a) to fix or determine prices;</p><p>(b) to restrict or control production, technical development or investment;</p><p>(c) to share markets, products, customers or sources of supply.</p><p>2. However, the Commission shall authorize specialization agreements or joint buying or joint selling agreements in respect of particular products, if it finds that: </p><p>(a) such specialization or such joint buying or joint selling will make for a substantial improvement in the production or distribution of those products; </p><p>(b) the agreement in question is essential in order to achieve these results and is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose; and</p><p>(c) the agreement is not liable to give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices, or to control or restrict the production or marketing, of a substantial part of the products in question within the common market, or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings within the common market.</p><p>If the Commission finds that certain agreements are strictly analogous in nature and effect to those referred to above, having particular regard to the fact that this paragraph applies to distributive undertakings, it shall authorize them also when satisfied that they meet the same requirements.</p><p>Authorizations may be granted subject to specified conditions and for limited periods. In such cases the Commission shall renew an authorization once or several times if it finds that the requirements of subparagraphs (a) to (c) are still met at the time of renewal.</p><p>The Commission shall revoke or amend an authorization if it finds that as a result of a change in circumstances the agreement no longer meets these requirements, or that the actual results of the agreement or of the application thereof are contrary to the requirements for its authorization.</p><p>Decisions granting, renewing, amending, refusing or revoking an authorization shall be published together with the reasons therefor; the restrictions imposed by the second paragraph of Article 47 shall not apply thereto.</p><p>3. The Commission may, as provided in Article 47, obtain any information needed for the application of this Article, either by making a special request to the parties concerned or by means of regulations stating the kinds of agreement, decision or practice which must be communicated to it.</p><p>4. Any agreement or decision prohibited by paragraph 1 of this Article shall be automatically void and may not be relied upon before any court or tribunal in the Member States.</p><p>The Commission shall have sole jurisdiction, subject to the right to bring actions before the Court, to rule whether any such agreement or decision is compatible with this Article.</p><p>5. On any undertaking which has entered into an agreement which is automatically void, or has enforced or attempted to enforce, by arbitration,penalty, boycott or any other means, an agreement or decision which is automatically void or an agreement for which authorization has been refused or revoked, or has obtained an authorization by means of information which it knew to be false or misleading, or has engaged in practices prohibited by paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission may impose fines or periodic penalty payments not exceeding twice the turnover on the products which were the subject of the agreement, decision or practice prohibited by this Article; if, however, the purpose of the agreement, decision or practice is to restrict production, technical development or investment, this maximum may be raised to 10% of the annual turnover of the undertakings in question in the case of fines, and 20% of the daily turnover in the case of periodic penalty payments. </p><p>  </p>
