<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Title IV - General provisions - Article 78b*</p><p>* As amended by Article 4 of the Treaty amending Certain Financial Provisions.</p><p> </p><p>1. If, at the beginning of a financial year, the administrative budget has not yet been voted, a sum equivalent to not more than one twelfth of the budget appropriations for the preceding financial year may be spent each month in respect of any chapter or other subdivision of the administrative budget in accordance with the provisions of the regulations made pursuant to Article 78h; this arrangement shall not, however, have the effect of placing at the disposal of the Commission appropriations in excess of one twelfth of those provided for in the draft administrative budget in course of preparation.</p><p>The Commission is authorized and required to impose the levies up to the amount of the appropriations for the preceding financial year, but shall not thereby exceed the amount which would have resulted from the adoption of the draft administrative budget.</p><p>2. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, provided that the other conditions laid down in paragraph 1 are observed, authorize expenditure in excess of one twelfth. The authorization and requirement to impose the levies may be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>If the decision relates to expenditure which does not necessarily result from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith, the Council shall forward it immediately to the European Parliament; within 30 days the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members and three fifths of the votes cast, may adopt a different decision on the expenditure in excess of the one twelfth referred to in paragraph 1. This part of the decision of the Council shall be suspended until the European Parliament has taken its decision. If within the said period the European Parliament has not taken a decision which differs from the decision of the Council, the latter shall be deemed to be finally adopted.</p><p>  </p>
