<p>Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community - Title III - Economic and social provisions - Chapter 5 - Prices - Article 63</p><p>1. If the Commission finds that discrimination is being systematically practised by purchasers, in particular under provisions governing contracts entered into by bodies dependent on a public authority, it shall make appropriate recommendations to the governments concerned.</p><p>2. Where the Commission considers it necessary, it may decide that:</p><p>(a) undertakings must frame their conditions of sale in such a way that their customers and commission agents acting on their behalf shall be under an obligation to comply with the rules made by the Commission in application of this Chapter; </p><p>(b) undertakings shall be held responsible for infringements of this obligation by their direct agents or by commission agents acting on their behalf.</p><p>In the event of an infringement of this obligation by a purchaser, the Commission may restrict or, should the infringement be repeated, temporarily prohibit dealings with that purchaser by Community undertakings. If this is done, the purchaser shall have the right, without prejudice to Article 33, to bring an action before the Court.</p><p>3. In addition, the Commission is empowered to make to the Member States concerned any appropriate recommendations to ensure that the rules laid down for the application of Article 60(1) are duly observed by all distributive undertakings and agencies in the coal and steel sectors.</p><p>  </p>
