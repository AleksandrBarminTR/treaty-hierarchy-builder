<p>Article 4</p><p>The following provisions shall be substituted for Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community:</p><p>Â»Article 203</p><p>1. The financial year shall run from 1 January to 31 December.</p><p>2. Each institution of the Community shall, before 1 July, draw up estimates of its expenditure. The Commission shall consolidate these estimates in a preliminary draft budget. It shall attach thereto an opinion which may obtain different estimates.</p><p>The preliminary draft budget shall contain an estimate of revenue and an estimate of expenditure.</p><p>3. The Commission shall place the preliminary draft budget before the Council not later than 1 September of the year preceding that in which the budget is to be implemented.</p><p>The Council shall consult the Commission and, where appropriate, the other institutions concerned whenever it intends to depart from the preliminary draft budget.</p><p>The Council shall, acting by a qualified majority, establish the draft budget and forward it to the European Parliament.</p><p>4. The draft budget shall be placed before the European Parliament not later than 5 October of the year preceding that which the budget is to be implemented.</p><p>The European Parliament shall have the right to amend the draft budget, acting by a majority of its members, and to propose to the Council, acting by an absolute majority of the votes cast, modifications to the draft budget relating to expenditure necessarily resulting from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith.</p><p>If, within 45 days of the draft budget being placed before it, the European Parliament has given its approval, the budget shall stand as finally adopted. If within this period the European Parliament has not amended the draft budget nor proposed any modifications thereto, the administrative budget shall be deemed to be finally adopted.</p><p>If within this period the European Parliament has adopted amendments or proposed modifications, the draft budget together with the amendments or proposed modifications shall be forwarded to the Council.</p><p>5. After discussing the draft budget with the Commission and, where appropriate, with the other institutions concerned, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority, modify any of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament and shall pronounce, also by a qualified majority, on the modifications proposed by the latter. The draft budget shall be modified on the basis of the proposed modifications accepted by the Council.</p><p>If, within 15 days of the draft being placed before it, the Council has not modified any of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament and has accepted the modifications proposed by the latter, the budget shall be deemed to be finally adopted. The Council shall inform the European Parliament that it has not modified any of the amendments and has accepted the proposed modifications.</p><p>If within this period the Council has modified one or more of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament or has not accepted the modifications proposed by the latter, the draft budget shall again be forwarded to the European Parliament. The Council shall inform the European Parliament of the results of its deliberations.</p><p>6. Within 15 days the draft budget being placed before it, the European Parliament, which shall have been notified of the action taken on its proposed modifications, shall act, by a majority of its members and three fifths of the votes cast, on the modifications to its amendments made by the Council, and shall adopt the budget accordingly. If within this period the European Parliament has not acted, the administrative budget shall be deemed to be finally adopted.</p><p>7. When the procedure provided for in this Article has been completed, the President of the European Parliament shall declare that the administrative budget has been finally adopted.</p><p>8. A maximum rate of increase in relation to the expenditure of the same type to be incurred during the current year shall be fixed annually for the total expenditure other than that necessarily resulting from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith.</p><p>The Commission shall, after consulting the Conjunctural Policy Committee and the Budgetary Policy Committee, declare what this maximum rate is at as it results from:</p><p>- the trend, in terms of volume, of the gross national product within the Community;</p><p>- the average variation in the budgets of the Member States;</p><p>and</p><p>- the trend of the cost of living during the preceding financial year.</p><p>The maximum rate shall be communicated, before 1 May, to all the institutions of the Community. The latter shall be required to conform to this during the budgetary procedure, subject to the provisions of the fourth and fifth subparagraphs of this paragraph.</p><p>If, in respect of expenditure other than necessarily resulting from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith, the actual rate of increase in the draft budget established by the Council is over half the maximum rate, the European Parliament may, exercising its right of amendment, further increase the total amount of that expenditure to a limit not exceeding half the maximum rate.</p><p>Where, in exceptional cases, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission considers that activities of the Communities require that the rate determined according to the procedure laid down in this paragraph should be exceeded, another rate may be fixed by agreement between the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its members and three fifths of the votes cast.</p><p>9. Each institution shall exercise the powers conferred upon it by this Article, with due regard for the provisions of this Treaty and for acts adopted in accordance therewith, in particular those relating to the Communities&#039; own resources and to the balance between revenue and expenditure.</p><p>  </p>
