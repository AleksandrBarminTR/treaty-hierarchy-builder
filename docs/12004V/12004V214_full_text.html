		<TXT_TE><p>Article III-214</p><p>1. Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for female and male workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.</p><p>2. For the purpose of this Article, "pay" means the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of his employment, from his employer.</p><p>Equal pay without discrimination based on sex means:</p><p>(a) that pay for the same work at piece rates shall be calculated on the basis of the same unit of measurement;</p><p>(b) that pay for work at time rates shall be the same for the same job.</p><p>3. European laws or framework laws shall establish measures to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of women and men in matters of employment and occupation, including the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. They shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>4. With a view to ensuring full equality in practice between women and men in working life, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity, or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
