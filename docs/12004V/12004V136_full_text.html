		<TXT_TE><p>Article III-136</p><p>1. In the field of social security, European laws or framework laws shall establish such measures as are necessary to bring about freedom of movement for workers by making arrangements to secure for employed and self-employed migrant workers and their dependants:</p><p>(a) aggregation, for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefit and of calculating the amount of benefit, of all periods taken into account under the laws of the different countries;</p><p>(b) payment of benefits to persons resident in the territories of Member States.</p><p>2. Where a member of the Council considers that a draft European law or framework law referred to in paragraph 1 would affect fundamental aspects of its social security system, including its scope, cost or financial structure, or would affect the financial balance of that system, it may request that the matter be referred to the European Council. In that case, the procedure referred to in Article III-396 shall be suspended. After discussion, the European Council shall, within four months of this suspension, either:</p><p>(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate the suspension of the procedure referred to in Article III-396, or</p><p>(b) request the Commission to submit a new proposal; in that case, the act originally proposed shall be deemed not to have been adopted.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
