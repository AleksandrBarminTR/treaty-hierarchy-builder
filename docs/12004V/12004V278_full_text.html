The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.</p><p>3. The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.</p><p>4.

They shall be adopted after consultation of the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>6. For the purposes of this Article, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations.</p><p>7.
