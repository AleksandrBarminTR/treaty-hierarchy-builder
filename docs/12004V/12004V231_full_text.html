		<TXT_TE><p>Article III-231</p><p>1. The Commission shall submit proposals for working out and implementing the common agricultural policy, including the replacement of the national organisations by one of the forms of common organisation provided for in Article III-228(1), and for implementing the measures referred to in this Section.</p><p>These proposals shall take account of the interdependence of the agricultural matters referred to in this Section.</p><p>2. European laws or framework laws shall establish the common organisation of the market provided for in Article III-228(1) and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. They shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>3. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the European regulations or decisions on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.</p><p>4. In accordance with paragraph 2, the national market organisations may be replaced by the common organisation provided for in Article III-228(1) if:</p><p>(a) the common organisation offers Member States which are opposed to this measure and which have an organisation of their own for the production in question equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the adjustments that will be possible and the specialisation that will be needed with the passage of time, and</p><p>(b) such an organisation ensures conditions for trade within the Union similar to those existing in a national market.</p><p>5. If a common organisation for certain raw materials is established before a common organisation exists for the corresponding processed products, such raw materials as are used for processed products intended for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Union.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
