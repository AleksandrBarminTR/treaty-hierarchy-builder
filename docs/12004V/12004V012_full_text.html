		<TXT_TE><p>Article I-12</p><p>Categories of competence</p><p>1. When the Constitution confers on the Union exclusive competence in a specific area, only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves only if so empowered by the Union or for the implementation of Union acts.</p><p>2. When the Constitution confers on the Union a competence shared with the Member States in a specific area, the Union and the Member States may legislate and adopt legally binding acts in that area. The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised, or has decided to cease exercising, its competence.</p><p>3. The Member States shall coordinate their economic and employment policies within arrangements as determined by Part III, which the Union shall have competence to provide.</p><p>4. The Union shall have competence to define and implement a common foreign and security policy, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy.</p><p>5. In certain areas and under the conditions laid down in the Constitution, the Union shall have competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States, without thereby superseding their competence in these areas.</p><p>Legally binding acts of the Union adopted on the basis of the provisions in Part III relating to these areas shall not entail harmonisation of Member States' laws or regulations.</p><p>6. The scope of and arrangements for exercising the Union's competences shall be determined by the provisions relating to each area in Part III.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
