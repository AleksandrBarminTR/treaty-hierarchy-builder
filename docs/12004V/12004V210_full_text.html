		<TXT_TE><p>Article III-210</p><p>1. With a view to achieving the objectives of Article III-209, the Union shall support and complement the activities of the Member States in the following fields:</p><p>(a) improvement in particular of the working environment to protect workers' health and safety;</p><p>(b) working conditions;</p><p>(c) social security and social protection of workers;</p><p>(d) protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated;</p><p>(e) the information and consultation of workers;</p><p>(f) representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers, including co-determination, subject to paragraph 6;</p><p>(g) conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Union territory;</p><p>(h) the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article III-283;</p><p>(i) equality between women and men with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work;</p><p>(j) the combating of social exclusion;</p><p>(k) the modernisation of social protection systems without prejudice to point (c).</p><p>2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:</p><p>(a) European laws or framework laws may establish measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States;</p><p>(b) in the fields referred to in paragraph 1(a) to (i), European framework laws may establish minimum requirements for gradual implementation, having regard to the conditions and technical rules obtaining in each of the Member States. Such European framework laws shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.</p><p>In all cases, such European laws or framework laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, in the fields referred to in paragraph 1(c), (d), (f) and (g), European laws or framework laws shall be adopted by the Council acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>The Council may, on a proposal from the Commission, adopt a European decision making the ordinary legislative procedure applicable to paragraph 1(d), (f) and (g). It shall act unanimously after consulting the European Parliament.</p><p>4. A Member State may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the implementation of European framework laws adopted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 or, where appropriate, with the implementation of European regulations or decisions adopted in accordance with Article III-212.</p><p>In this case, it shall ensure that, no later than the date on which a European framework law must be transposed, or a European regulation or decision implemented, management and labour have introduced the necessary measures by agreement, the Member State concerned being required to take any necessary measure enabling it at any time to be in a position to guarantee the results imposed by that framework law, regulation or decision.</p><p>5. The European laws and framework laws adopted pursuant to this Article:</p><p>(a) shall not affect the right of Member States to define the fundamental principles of their social security systems and must not significantly affect the financial equilibrium of such systems;</p><p>(b) shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures compatible with the Constitution.</p><p>6. This Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lockouts.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
