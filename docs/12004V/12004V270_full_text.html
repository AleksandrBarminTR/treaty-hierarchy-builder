		<TXT_TE><p>Article III-270</p><p>1. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union shall be based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions and shall include the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 and in Article III-271.</p><p>European laws or framework laws shall establish measures to:</p><p>(a) lay down rules and procedures for ensuring recognition throughout the Union of all forms of judgments and judicial decisions;</p><p>(b) prevent and settle conflicts of jurisdiction between Member States;</p><p>(c) support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff;</p><p>(d) facilitate cooperation between judicial or equivalent authorities of the Member States in relation to proceedings in criminal matters and the enforcement of decisions.</p><p>2. To the extent necessary to facilitate mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions and police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters having a cross-border dimension, European framework laws may establish minimum rules. Such rules shall take into account the differences between the legal traditions and systems of the Member States.</p><p>They shall concern:</p><p>(a) mutual admissibility of evidence between Member States;</p><p>(b) the rights of individuals in criminal procedure;</p><p>(c) the rights of victims of crime;</p><p>(d) any other specific aspects of criminal procedure which the Council has identified in advance by a European decision; for the adoption of such a decision, the Council shall act unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.</p><p>Adoption of the minimum rules referred to in this paragraph shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing a higher level of protection for individuals.</p><p>3. Where a member of the Council considers that a draft European framework law as referred to in paragraph 2 would affect fundamental aspects of its criminal justice system, it may request that the draft framework law be referred to the European Council. In that case, the procedure referred to in Article III-396 shall be suspended. After discussion, the European Council shall, within four months of this suspension, either:</p><p>(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate the suspension of the procedure referred to in Article III-396, or</p><p>(b) request the Commission or the group of Member States from which the draft originates to submit a new draft; in that case, the act originally proposed shall be deemed not to have been adopted.</p><p>4. If, by the end of the period referred to in paragraph 3, either no action has been taken by the European Council or if, within 12 months from the submission of a new draft under paragraph 3(b), the European framework law has not been adopted, and at least one third of the Member States wish to establish enhanced cooperation on the basis of the draft framework law concerned, they shall notify the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission accordingly.</p><p>In such a case, the authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation referred to in Articles I-44(2) and III-419(1) shall be deemed to be granted and the provisions on enhanced cooperation shall apply.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
