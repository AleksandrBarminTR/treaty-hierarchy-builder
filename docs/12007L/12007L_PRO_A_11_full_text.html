In accordance with Article 9 C(4) of the Treaty on European Union, the provisions of that paragraph and of Article 205(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union relating to the definition of the qualified majority in the European Council and the Council shall take effect on 1 November 2014.</p><p>2. Between 1 November 2014 and 31 March 2017, when an act is to be adopted by qualified majority, a member of the Council may request that it be adopted in accordance with the qualified majority as defined in paragraph 3. In that case, paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply.</p><p>3. Until 31 October 2014, the following provisions shall remain in force, without prejudice to the second subparagraph of Article 201a(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>For acts of the European Council and of the Council requiring a qualified majority, members' votes shall be weighted as follows:</p><p>Belgium | 12 |</p><p>Bulgaria | 10 |</p><p>Czech Republic | 12 |</p><p>Denmark | 7 |</p><p>Germany | 29 |</p><p>Estonia | 4 |</p><p>Ireland | 7 |</p><p>Greece | 12 |</p><p>Spain | 27 |</p><p>France | 29 |</p><p>Italy | 29 |</p><p>Cyprus | 4 |</p><p>Latvia | 4 |</p><p>Lithuania | 7 |</p><p>Luxembourg | 4 |</p><p>Hungary | 12 |</p><p>Malta | 3 |</p><p>Netherlands | 13 |</p><p>Austria | 10 |</p><p>Poland | 27 |</p><p>Portugal | 12 |</p><p>Romania | 14 |</p><p>Slovenia | 4 |</p><p>Slovakia | 7 |</p><p>Finland | 7 |</p><p>Sweden | 10 |</p><p>United Kingdom | 29 |</p><p>Acts shall be adopted if there are at least 255 votes in favour representing a majority of the members where, under the Treaties, they must be adopted on a proposal from the Commission.

If that proves not to be the case, the act shall not be adopted.</p><p>4. Until 31 October 2014, the qualified majority shall, in cases where, under the Treaties, not all the members of the Council participate in voting, namely in the cases where reference is made to the qualified majority as defined in Article 205(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, be defined as the same proportion of the weighted votes and the same proportion of the number of the Council members and, if appropriate, the same percentage of the population of the Member States concerned as laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article.</p><p>TITLE III</p><p>PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE COUNCIL</p><p>Article 4</p><p>Until the entry into force of the decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 9 C(6) of the Treaty on European Union, the Council may meet in the configurations laid down in the second and third subparagraphs of that paragraph and in the other configurations on the list established by a decision of the General Affairs Council, acting by a simple majority.</p><p>TITLE IV</p><p>PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE COMMISSION, INCLUDING THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECURITY POLICY</p><p>Article 5</p><p>The members of the Commission in office on the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon shall remain in office until the end of their term of office.

The same shall apply to agreements concluded between Member States on the basis of the Treaty on European Union.</p><p>Article 10</p><p>1. As a transitional measure, and with respect to acts of the Union in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters which have been adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the powers of the institutions shall be the following at the date of entry into force of that Treaty: the powers of the Commission under Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall not be applicable and the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Union under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, in the version in force before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, shall remain the same, including where they have been accepted under Article 35(2) of the said Treaty on European Union.</p><p>2. The amendment of an act referred to in paragraph 1 shall entail the applicability of the powers of the institutions referred to in that paragraph as set out in the Treaties with respect to the amended act for those Member States to which that amended act shall apply.</p><p>3. In any case, the transitional measure mentioned in paragraph 1 shall cease to have effect five years after the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p><p>4. At the latest six months before the expiry of the transitional period referred to in paragraph 3, the United Kingdom may notify to the Council that it does not accept, with respect to the acts referred to in paragraph 1, the powers of the institutions referred to in paragraph 1 as set out in the Treaties. In case the United Kingdom has made that notification, all acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall cease to apply to it as from the date of expiry of the transitional period referred to in paragraph 3. This subparagraph shall not apply with respect to the amended acts which are applicable to the United Kingdom as referred to in paragraph 2.</p><p>The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine the necessary consequential and transitional arrangements. The United Kingdom shall not participate in the adoption of this decision. A qualified majority of the Council shall be defined in accordance with Article 205(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt a decision determining that the United Kingdom shall bear the direct financial consequences, if any, necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in those acts.</p><p>5. The United Kingdom may, at any time afterwards, notify the Council of its wish to participate in acts which have ceased to apply to it pursuant to paragraph 4, first subparagraph. In that case, the relevant provisions of the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union or of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as the case may be, shall apply. The powers of the institutions with regard to those acts shall be those set out in the Treaties. When acting under the relevant Protocols, the Union institutions and the United Kingdom shall seek to re-establish the widest possible measure of participation of the United Kingdom in the acquis of the Union in the area of freedom, security and justice without seriously affecting the practical operability of the various parts thereof, while respecting their coherence.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p></TXT_TE></p>
