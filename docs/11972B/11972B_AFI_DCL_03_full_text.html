THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY WILL EXAMINE THE PROBLEMS OF THE FISH MEAL AND FISH OILS SECTOR WITH A VIEW TO ADOPTING MEASURES WHICH MIGHT PROVE NECESSARY IN THAT SECTOR WITH RESPECT TO THE RAW MATERIAL USED . THESE MEASURES SHOULD MEET THE NEED FOR PROTECTION AND RATIONAL USE OF THE SEA&#039;S BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES WHILE AVOIDING THE CREATION OR RETENTION OF INSUFFICIENTLY PROFITABLE PRODUCTION UNITS .  </p><p>2 . THE APPLICATION OF COMMON MARKETING STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN FRESH OR CHILLED FISH MUST NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF EXCLUDING ANY MARKETING METHOD AND , CONVERSELY , NO MARKETING METHOD SHOULD HINDER THE APPLICATION OF THE SAID STANDARDS ; IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT THE PROBLEMS WHICH COULD ARISE MAY BE SETTLED WHEN THE TIME COMES BY THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY .  </p><p>3 . THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY IS AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NORWEGIAN EXPORTS OF FISH PRODUCTS TO THIRD COUNTRIES , WHICH ARE SUBJECT LIKE OTHER COMMUNITY EXPORTS TO REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2142/70 .  </p><p>4 .
