The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the Western European Union (WEU) and NATO, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this title.</p><p></p><p>5. With a view to furthering the objectives of this Article, the provisions of this Article will be reviewed in accordance with Article 48. </p>
