THE ABOVEMENTIONED PRODUCER PRICES SHALL CORRESPOND TO AN AVERAGE OF THE PRICE QUOTATIONS RECORDED OVER THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF FIXING THE ABOVEMENTIONED COMMUNITY OFFER PRICE . THE ANNUAL COMMUNITY PRICE MAY NOT EXCEED THE LEVEL OF THE REFERENCE PRICE APPLIED VIS-A-VIS THIRD COUNTRIES . THIS COMMUNITY OFFER PRICE SHALL BE REDUCED BY 3 % AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST MOVE TOWARDS PRICE ALIGNMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 59 , BY 6 % AT THE TIME OF THE SECOND MOVE , 9 % AT THE TIME OF THE THIRD MOVE , BY 12 % AT THE TIME OF THE FOURTH MOVE , BY 15 % AT THE TIME OF THE FIFTH MOVE AND , AS REGARDS PEACHES AND TOMATOES , BY 18 % AT THE TIME OF THE SIXTH MOVE , AND BY 21 % AT THE TIME OF THE SEVENTH MOVE .  </p><p>( B ) THE OFFER PRICE OF THE GREEK PRODUCT SHALL BE CALCULATED , EACH MARKET DAY , ON THE BASIS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE PRICE QUOTATIONS RECORDED OR REDUCED TO THE IMPORTER-WHOLESALER STAGE IN THE COMMUNITY AS AT PRESENT CONSTITUTED .

THIS OR THESE PRICE QUOTATIONS SHALL BE REDUCED BY ANY CORRECTIVE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE INTRODUCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS LAID DOWN HEREINAFTER IN ( C ) .  </p><p>( C ) IF THE GREEK PRICE , THUS CALCULATED , SHALL BE LESS THAN THE COMMUNITY PRICE , AS INDICATED IN ( A ) , A CORRECTIVE AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO PRICES SHALL BE LEVIED ON IMPORTATION INTO THE COMMUNITY AS AT PRESENT CONSTITUTED BY THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE . IF THE DAILY OFFER PRICE OF THE COMMUNITY PRODUCT CALCULATED FROM THE MARKETS OF THE CENTRES OF CONSUMPTION IS AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE COMMUNITY PRICE AS DEFINED IN ( A ) , THE CORRECTIVE AMOUNT MAY , HOWEVER , NOT EXCEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN , ON THE ONE HAND , THE ARITHMETICAL AVERAGE OF THESE TWO PRICES AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , THE PRICE OF THE GREEK PRODUCT .  </p><p>( D ) THE CORRECTIVE AMOUNT SHALL BE LEVIED UNTIL RECORDS TAKEN SHOW THAT THE PRICE OF THE GREEK PRODUCT IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN EITHER , THE COMMUNITY PRICE AS DEFINED IN ( A ) OR , WHERE APPROPRIATE , THE ARITHMETICAL AVERAGE OF COMMUNITY PRICES REFERRED TO IN ( C ) .  </p><p>3 . THE COMPENSATORY MECHANISM PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL REMAIN IN FORCE :  </p><p>( A ) UNTIL 31 DECEMBER 1987 FOR THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 59 ( 2 ) ;  </p><p>( B ) UNTIL 31 DECEMBER 1985 FOR THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 59 ( 3 ) .  </p><p>4 .
